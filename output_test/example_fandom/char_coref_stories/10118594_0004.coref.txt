`` Is that my shirt ? '' 
His ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) head is ringing and his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) vision blurred around the edges , but the first thing that catches his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) attention is Uraraka_Ochako ($_Uraraka_Ochako) , sitting with her ($_Uraraka_Ochako) back to him ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) . In his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) shirt . 
`` Good evening , Bakugou ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) , '' she ($_Uraraka_Ochako) says , glancing over at him ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) once while he ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) sits up slowly . She ($_Uraraka_Ochako) returns to whatever she ($_Uraraka_Ochako) 's doing with her ($_Uraraka_Ochako) hands in the next moment . `` How 's your ($_Uraraka_Ochako) head ? '' 
Things are coming back to him ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) slowly . The woods are quiet around them , the last light of the day leaving the sky . His ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) head hurts and his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) back is sore like he ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) was pummeled with a bunch of rocks . He ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) blinks a few times and rolls his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) neck gingerly . 
“…fuckin’ hurts.” She ($_Uraraka_Ochako) hums and the ring in his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) ears dies down enough for him ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) to distinguish the clicking noise coming from her ($_Uraraka_Ochako) hands . `` What the hell are you ($_Uraraka_Ochako) doing ? Why are you ($_Uraraka_Ochako) wearing my fucking shirt ? What - '' He ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) 's cut off by her ($_Uraraka_Ochako) clipped and frosty tones . 
`` Trying to start a fire , you ass . Lay back down before you hurt yourself again . '' 
`` Gim me that . '' He ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) shifts and rips the flat stones out of her ($_Uraraka_Ochako) hands , back twinging with the sudden movement . He ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) holds his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) hand above the small pile of kindling Uraraka ($_Uraraka_Ochako) had put together and ignites his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) quirk . If the blast is a little too big for starting a camp fire , then he ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) pretends not to notice . The ends of Uraraka ($_Uraraka_Ochako) 's hair catch some embers , but she ($_Uraraka_Ochako) just glares at him ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) while putting it out between her ($_Uraraka_Ochako) palms . 
Bakugou ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) rolls his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) eyes , tossing the stones over his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) shoulder into the underbrush . The sun is wholly down now and the flickering of the fire brings his ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) attention to a tiny pile of light green cloth sitting on the ground . 
Or , it would be light green , if it was n't murky brownish red . 
Uraraka ($_Uraraka_Ochako) had been wearing a light green tank when they 'd left that morning for today 's lesson : a wilderness survival course . He glances over to where he 'd been lying and there 's another stretch of fabric , ripped in some places , dark colors laid out in concentrated patches . Uraraka ($_Uraraka_Ochako) 's empty canteen is next to it . Bakugou ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) reaches to touch his back , muscles arguing with the motion . His hand comes back with dried blood . 
He works his jaw as he looks over at her , trying to think what he should say . The back of his shirt is baggy on her , but there are more than a few tears in it . She 's still glaring at him , eyes glowering in the flames ' light . He opens his mouth and is cut off again as he puts all the pieces together . 
`` Get it now ? '' -- running into Uraraka ($_Uraraka_Ochako) on his way to the next checkpoint - `` You totally screwed up - '' -- trying to slow her up by using his quirk - `` when you caused that rock slide - '' -- the loose scree rumbling and larger rocks breaking , tumbling - `` - and then you dove - '' -- the panic caused his body to move - `` - right on top of me , immobilizing my hands ! '' -- tucking her head under his chin , then pain and blackness - `` You absolute idiot ! '' 
Bakugou ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) 's eyes are wide , taking the influx of memories and the image of Uraraka_towering_over_him ($_Uraraka_Ochako) . When did he edge back onto his palms , back away ? The fire is behind her now , darkening her face but making her hair burn amber-gold as it puffs out in irritation . 
`` I had to drag your dead weight around and patch you up without a first aid kit , '' she growls . 
She makes a sudden motion forward and he 's on his elbows , back protesting . There 's a rock floating in front of his face , but he ca n't focus with Uraraka ($_Uraraka_Ochako) 's hands pressed into the dirt next to his hips as she looms over him . 
`` ... when all I would have had to do was make us float over the debris . '' 
He gulps , because he 's never seen Uraraka this pissed . `` So now we have no more clean water - '' The sport festival was apparently just the tip of the iceberg when considering how un fragile this girl was . `` and my shirt was ruined by your explosion and the rockslide - '' He wets his mouth again before trying to talk ; the fury on her normally open features and the tension in her shoulders covered by his shirt seem to have made his saliva flee . `` - so I used it to pull all the dirt out of your back . '' 
`` Shit , Uraraka ($_Uraraka_Ochako) , I - '' 
`` So yes , I am wearing your damn shirt . '' 
`` I-fuck , I did n't think - '' the rock falls , bouncing off his sternum . 
`` No , Bakugou_Katsuki ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) , you did n't . '' 
It 's suddenly a lot cooler and it 's because Uraraka ($_Uraraka_Ochako) has backed up to her own space . His head is reeling again , warm . He holds a hand to his forehead without thinking , the skin warm to the touch there and on his cheeks . His slow return to vertical has her looking at him again , with a more contemplative look . 
Thankfully , she does n't appear to be contemplating murder . 
Her hand is pulling his away by the wrist . The back of her other hand touches his face , cool to his heating cheeks . Her mouth pulls into a cross between a frown and pout , gears churning in her head . `` I cleaned out all your cuts best I could , did you catch a fever ? Are they infected ? '' She 's turning his torso as much as it would allow , inspecting her own handiwork . Apparently satisfied , she touches her hand to his face again . `` You 're all flushed and sweaty ... '' 
She rubs her fingers together , testing whether the sweat felt like the nitroglycerin that comes off his palms . She wipes her hand on his shirt and leans up . Pushing their bangs back with each hand , her forehead presses against his and she murmurs , `` Do n't blow me up now ... '' 
Bakugou ($_Bakugou_Katsuki) combusts internally and stays completely still . Nothing about this situation is computing and his mind stutters to a halt . Brown eyes are closed and he can count her eyelashes if he wanted to . A girly hand is in his hair and as his eyes drift closed and he starts to sway forward , the cool skin against his head leaves and Uraraka ($_Uraraka_Ochako) 's hand is guiding him back towards her ($_Uraraka_Ochako) into the light of the fire . Her ($_Uraraka_Ochako) brown eyes are softer than before . 
That hand is very soft , and gentle , until it pulls against his eyelids in turn . 
`` Well , I do n't know about infection , but you do n't seem to have a concussion . '' 
When her ($_Uraraka_Ochako) hand leaves his face , he almost wishes he did . ... shit .
