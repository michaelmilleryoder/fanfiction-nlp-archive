11467887,1,1,"Yellow , red , green , blue -- those were the colors that made up Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) 's memories . 
"
11467887,1,2,"Laughter , a happy glowing yellow , once filled her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) home from time to time . It spread from mother to child and drowned out all other dark colors that prowled in the shadowed corners of the Todoroki household . 
"
11467887,1,3,"The brilliant yellow was always followed by other colors -- reds , blues , and greens . All together , they created a loving and peaceful comfort that flowed like waterfalls from the hearts of Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) and her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) dear family . These colors , they were symbols of a happy house . A happy house was what Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) had hoped hers ($_Mrs._Todoroki) would one day become but sadly , her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) dream was only that -- a dream . 
"
11467887,1,4,"Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) sat by the window of her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) room but did not stare out into the garden below or the clouds in the sky . Her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) eyes were shut , mind somewhere deep inside her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) head . There , she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) was surrounded by a scatter of endless color . 
"
11467887,1,5,"That scatter of color was because of her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) condition -- a condition caused by traumatic experiences that caused her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) own mind to collapse in on itself . Her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) memories were no longer considered normal . She ($_Mrs._Todoroki) could n't see her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) children 's sweet smiles or her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) husband 's boot crashing towards her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) ribs . All she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) could see were swirls of color . 
"
11467887,1,6,"`` Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) ? '' Her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) doctor -- a soft orange -- pressed a hand to her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) shoulder . `` You ($_Mrs._Todoroki) have visitors . '' 
"
11467887,1,7,"`` Visitors ? '' 
"
11467887,1,8,"A moment of panic thrummed through her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) chest and her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) mangled memories zoomed right before her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) eyes . She ($_Mrs._Todoroki) saw blood red swallow a fading white -- an image that haunted her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) night and day . 
"
11467887,1,9,"`` Your ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son , '' the doctor reassured quickly with a sad smile . `` He 's brought a friend too . '' 
"
11467887,1,10,"`` Son ? '' 
"
11467887,1,11,"The door clicked open again and Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) turned from the window to see her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) new visitors . 
"
11467887,1,12,"A boy -- half red and half white -- stood silently by the door . 
"
11467887,1,13,"A mix of white and red flickered somewhere deep within Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) 's mind as she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) stared at the boy . For a split second , the mix of color thrummed with life and joy in the dark but in the next second , it was snuffed out by a bubbling black . 
"
11467887,1,14,"Tears built in the corners of Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) 's eyes as she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) slowly remembered . `` My ($_Mrs._Todoroki) -- my ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son , '' she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) croaked . `` My ($_Mrs._Todoroki) boy -- '' 
"
11467887,1,15,"A small smile eased over her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) baby 's lips . `` Hey , Mom , '' he said softly and he held up a bouquet colored in yellow . `` Brought you some new flowers . '' 
"
11467887,1,16,"`` I 'll toss out the old ones from last week , '' the doctor reassured and he scooped up a vase of dead yellow flowers from Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) 's bedside desk . `` Give me a shout if you need anything , '' he called over his shoulder and in the next second , he was gone . 
"
11467887,1,17,"Space was something Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) greatly appreciated . After years of being cooped up with no word from her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) family , she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) yearned to have these blessed moments to herself ($_Mrs._Todoroki) . 
"
11467887,1,18,"Her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son felt the same . 
"
11467887,1,19,"`` Do you ($_Mrs._Todoroki) remember me ? '' 
"
11467887,1,20,"Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) stared at her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son , mapping the curves of his face and the raw emotion glittering in his eyes . 
"
11467887,1,21,"No , she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) did n't remember him . At least , not like she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) used to . His face , his words , his actions -- they were n't physical things that played in her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) memories like a movie clip . They were instead compressed and transformed into an ever-changing ball of color . Every memory of hers , every person she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) 's met , every feeling she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) 's ever had had its own vibrant or sometimes dull shade of color . 
"
11467887,1,22,"Her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son sighed when she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) did n't answer but his smile stayed on his face as he stepped to the side . To his mother 's surprise , there was a boy standing behind him . He had freckles and a nervous smile on his lips but those pieces of him Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) would never remember . No , instead , all she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) would remember was the powerful green color that was slowly building in her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) mind . 
"
11467887,1,23,"`` Hello , '' she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) greeted . `` Are you ($_Mrs._Todoroki) a friend of my son 's ? '' 
"
11467887,1,24,"`` Best friend , '' her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) boy corrected and he placed a hand on the other boy 's shoulder . `` Mom , this is -- '' he stopped , teeth biting his lip . 
"
11467887,1,25,"Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) did n't have to ask why her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son had stopped . Memories were n't the same for her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) . Thoughts , feelings -- those could be turned into color but the name of her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son or his best friend ? Well , that was sometimes too difficult for her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) at times . 
"
11467887,1,26,"It was n't her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) fault her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) memories were as they were . She ($_Mrs._Todoroki) knew this but she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) still could n't help but hate herself ($_Mrs._Todoroki) -- her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) own mind . It had only tried to protect itself after the traumatic day that had finally pushed her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) to snap . Her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) mind had torn apart her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) memories , giving her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) simple shapes of color to view over the disgusting images of constant abuse and her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) baby boy 's burning face . However , it had gone too far and now each day was a struggle not_only_for_Mrs._Todoroki_but_her_family ($_Mrs._Todoroki) her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) family as well . 
"
11467887,1,27,"`` Shouto ... '' The nameless boy touched Mrs. Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) 's son . His ($_Shouto) fingers smoothed through Shouto ($_Shouto) 's hair with a gentle caress and he ($_Shouto) whispered something softly into the boy 's ear . With that touch and those gentle words , Shouto ($_Shouto) 's muscles relaxed and the colors in his ($_Shouto) mother 's head suddenly started to glow with warmth . 
"
11467887,1,28,"`` He ($_Shouto) 's the boy that makes you happy , '' Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) finished for her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son as she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) watched the gentle and loving display . `` I ($_Mrs._Todoroki) 'll remember that . '' 
"
11467887,1,29,"Her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son rubbed at his eyes . `` Thanks , mom , '' he sniffled . 
"
11467887,1,30,"Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) stood from her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) chair and walked over to her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) son . She ($_Mrs._Todoroki) wrapped her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) arms around her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) boy 's strong frame , pulling him into a tight embrace . `` Oh , Shouto ($_Shouto) , '' she ($_Mrs._Todoroki) hummed , his name finally coming back to her ($_Mrs._Todoroki) . `` I 've missed you , baby . '' 
"
11467887,1,31,"`` Missed you too , Mom . '' Shouto ($_Shouto) pulled back a little and searched her ($_Shouto) eyes . `` They 're still treating you alright here ? '' 
"
11467887,1,32,"`` Yes , '' she ($_Shouto) reassured . `` I ($_Shouto) 'm safe , Shouto ($_Shouto) . '' She ($_Shouto) pulled her ($_Shouto) boy back into a hug , this time managing to grab his friend and drag him in too . The boy that glowed a comforting green in her ($_Shouto) memories now laughed and held onto his friend and Mrs._Todoroki ($_Mrs._Todoroki) with all his might and love . 
"
11467887,1,33,"Good days , bad days -- they came and went for Shouto ($_Shouto) 's mother . With each of Shouto ($_Shouto) 's many visits , however , those bad days were thankfully becoming less and less . One day , maybe sometime in the far future with Shouto ($_Shouto) and his new friend 's help , she ($_Shouto) 'd finally recover and finally look at her ($_Shouto) baby boy 's face and remember that darling smile .
