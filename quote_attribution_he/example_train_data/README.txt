Introduction
============
This README describes the data files on the novel of Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen for the speaker identification task.

If you do use the data (or the ideas in our paper) I'd be interested in hearing about it. If the data go into academic research, a good scientific practice would probably recommend citing our paper in below, but of course ultimately that decision is yours based on how much information you use from our paper/data: 

Hua He, Denilson Barbosa, Grzegorz Kondrak.
Identification of Speakers in Novels.
