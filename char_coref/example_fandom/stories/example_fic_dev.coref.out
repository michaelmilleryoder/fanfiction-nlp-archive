A second trip to the local healing clinic -LRB- a hairline fracture -- easily fixed -RRB- and an awkward explanation to his ($_izuku) mom later , Midoriya ($_midoriya) is back at home and condemned from leaving the house -- regardless of whether or not he ($_izuku) wants to test out his ($_izuku) new abilities . 
But despite the house arrest , Midoriya ($_midoriya) can t help but smile . His ($_izuku) mom seems pretty excited , too -- she witnessed his ($_izuku) rock firsthand , and although she can t entirely grasp how it took Izuku ($_izuku) fourteen years to figure out bending , she s ecstatic for her son . 
She bustles around the house , pulling out ingredients from the pantry and trying to tap at her phone at the same time . 
Oh , I m so excited for you , Izuku ($_izuku) ! Earthbending! Can you believe it ? I m going to make you a cake . And I ll call your father -- oh ! He ll be so surprised ! He might want to come back in when he has a free day to say congrats -- 
Mom . Mom -- thank you . I m happy you re excited , too , Midoriya ($_midoriya) interrupts , walking over and leaning on the kitchen counter . He ($_midoriya) smiles warmly . But seriously , you don t have to make me a cake . I kind of just want to go to bed right now , I m beat . 
She blinks , then beams back at him ($_midoriya) . Oh , of course ! It s been quite the day for you -- I should have figured you d want to sleep . 
She places her phone and rolling pin on the counter , shuffling over to her son . Standing on tiptoes , she deposits a kiss on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s forehead . 
I m very proud of you , she says softly . You never gave up , did you ? 
He ($_midoriya) smiles , then shakes his ($_midoriya) head slowly . She holds his ($_midoriya) shoulders , tears beading at the corners of her eyes . 
He ($_midoriya) kisses her forehead in turn , then pulling away to walk towards his ($_midoriya) bedroom . 
Night , Mom . 
Goodnight , Izuku ($_izuku) . 
The door closes behind him ($_midoriya) and he ($_midoriya) plops onto his ($_midoriya) bed , dwelling on what a day it s been . 
How could his ($_midoriya) life have changed so much in 24 hours ? How could he ($_midoriya) have gone from a non-bending nobody to the avatar ? 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) flops backwards , and then the overwhelming nature of what comes next hits him ($_midoriya) . 
He ($_midoriya) needs to go back to_the_Spirit_World ($_the) to talk to All Might and figure out his ($_midoriya) plan , pronto . 
The only method he ($_midoriya) knows of is sleep -- when he ($_midoriya) falls asleep , he ($_midoriya) should be able to go there . 
So he ($_midoriya) tries . He ($_midoriya) lays on his ($_midoriya) bed , staring blankly at the ceiling . 
This should be easy -- he ($_midoriya) 's supposedly the bridge between the human world and the_Spirit_World ($_the) , so he ($_midoriya) should be able to cross over with no problem . He ($_midoriya) just needs to focus , to try to meditate and cross that chasm . 
But as he ($_midoriya) gazes upwards and tries to clear his ($_midoriya) thoughts , muffled worries cloud his ($_midoriya) mind . 
Why was n't I able to bend up until now ? What 's wrong with me ? 
Who do I talk to ? I do n't know what to do and I ca n't contact my only source of advice . 
What if I ca n't get into Yuuei ? How will I master bending if I do n't go there -- will I have to leave home ? Without telling my mom ? 
The_Spirit_World ($_the) slips from his ($_the) grasp and he ($_the) shifts to his ($_the) side with a weary sigh , resigning himself ($_the) to a restless sleep . 
x
There s no school the next day and his ($_the) mom leaves the house telling him ($_the) to stay put and rest -- but the second she closes the door behind her , he ($_the) pulls on a jacket and slides on his ($_the) shoes . 
He ($_the) s not well , but he ($_the) can t rest easy until he ($_the) knows the full extent of his ($_the) bending abilities . He ($_the) has to see if he ($_the) can bend more than just earth and air . 
Past the back lot and under the cover of trees , Midoriya ($_midoriya) comes to a stop . His ($_midoriya) head still has that cotton feeling that dulls his ($_midoriya) senses slightly , but overall he ($_midoriya) feels much more focused and refreshed . He ($_midoriya) uncaps a waterbottle and places it on the ground , then goes to stand five feet away . 
First up : waterbending . 
He ($_midoriya) mimics the movements he ($_midoriya) sees all the time on TV -- the back and forth , the pushing and pulling , the fluid arm circles . 
But the movements are too smooth , too gentle -- he ($_midoriya) can t figure out how to transfer his ($_midoriya) energy into the water without the powerful and decisive motions of earthbending . 
He ($_midoriya) tries for a couple more minutes , then drops the positioning with a sigh . 
Okay , now for the one he ($_midoriya) has even less hope with : firebending . 
It s the same deal as waterbending ; he ($_midoriya) goes through the pro motions , sharp jabs and thrusts . But the sheer emotion equated with firebending , the power that those benders display -- Midoriya ($_midoriya) can t tap into it . 
Sure , he ($_midoriya) s got fight in him ($_midoriya) . 
But he ($_midoriya) can t seem to draw it out in the form of fire . 
He ($_midoriya) treks back home , disappointed but not surprised . 
All that s left to do now is to try to talk to All Might and get some answers . 
x
He ($_midoriya) tries for a week : meditating , deep breathing , music . Anything to relax and help him ($_midoriya) cross over . 
But nothing works . He ($_midoriya) always begins to think of his ($_midoriya) troubles , to worry about the path ahead . 
It s a cycle -- his ($_midoriya) anxiety means he ($_midoriya) can t make it to the Spirit World , but not getting to the Spirit World is causing him ($_midoriya) even more anxiety . It s excessively stupid and he ($_midoriya) knows that he ($_midoriya) needs to calm down , to let his ($_midoriya) worries go . 
But he ($_midoriya) can t. That s not in his ($_midoriya) nature . 
It s after another failed attempt that Midoriya ($_midoriya) hoists himself ($_midoriya) , blurry-eyed , from the bed . He ($_midoriya) goes to sit at his ($_midoriya) desk , head in his ($_midoriya) hands , staring at the wood grain below . 
He ($_midoriya) s beginning to wonder if that whole thing with All Might was a fever dream , that he ($_midoriya) s the avatar but he ($_midoriya) never actually had that discussion with his ($_midoriya) predecessor . 
Why is he ($_midoriya) so bad at this ? Wasn t this supposed to come naturally ? 
He ($_midoriya) stares at the desk for another second , then raises his ($_midoriya) head . Reaching for his ($_midoriya) laptop , he ($_midoriya) flips it open and frantically types . 
avatar life biographies 
It s a dumb Google search , he ($_midoriya) knows . But he ($_midoriya) needs to know that he ($_midoriya) s not alone , that what he ($_midoriya) s going through is normal . 
He ($_midoriya) clicks the first link and begins to read . 
An airbending avatar , 10 lifetimes back , that didn t master all the elements until she was 36 . A firebending avatar , 3 lifetimes ago , that struggled consistently with going into the Avatar State . Another earthbender , 8 lifetimes past , that avoided all other kinds of bending , finding them foreign and difficult . 
The story that comforts him ($_midoriya) the most is All Might s. 
Avatar_Toshinori ($_toshinori) was reportedly unable to visit the_Spirit_World ($_the) until he ($_toshinori) was eighteen , the article reads . When asked about the most difficult part of his ($_toshinori) journey to become a fully-realized avatar , he ($_toshinori) responded with : the spiritual aspect . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) stares at the words , a faint smile creeping on his ($_midoriya) face . 
He ($_midoriya) s not alone . He ($_midoriya) s never been alone . His ($_midoriya) struggle has been going on for centuries , and he ($_midoriya) s far from the first avatar to not know what to do . 
Even when a deep tiredness settles into his ($_midoriya) bones , he ($_midoriya) continues to scroll through his ($_midoriya) past lives . 
He ($_midoriya) feels connected . 
When he ($_midoriya) begins to doze off , cheek on the desk and eyes still on the computer , there s something like a humming that leaks into his ($_midoriya) ears . He ($_midoriya) lets his ($_midoriya) eyes sink shut , and the humming overtakes him ($_midoriya) , filling his ($_midoriya) ears and sinking into his ($_midoriya) limbs . 
He ($_midoriya) lets it engulf him ($_midoriya) . 
x
He ($_midoriya) can sense the difference before his ($_midoriya) eyes even flick open . 
The air around him ($_midoriya) feels lighter , the ache of his ($_midoriya) limbs fading and the weight of his ($_midoriya) eyelids lessening . 
He ($_midoriya) blinks , taking in the familiar clearing and lush greenery . But a quick survey shows that the former avatar is nowhere to be seen . 
A sense of panic settles in his ($_midoriya) core . 
All Might ? he ($_midoriya) questions quietly . Only silence greets him ($_midoriya) . Then it hits him ($_midoriya) . 
It 's just silence -- no noise from the babbling stream or the insects from within the trees , like last time . Simply eerie quietness , thick and foreboding . 
Something s wrong . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) whips around , suddenly growing paranoid that he ($_midoriya) 's being watched . The landscape seems to darken , the shadows in between trees growing blacker and the foliage taking on a gray tint . He ($_midoriya) nervously scans , trying to find the source of his ($_midoriya) unease . 
A wave of something hits him ($_midoriya) , grim and heavy . Gravity seems to grow exponentially stronger but he ($_midoriya) fights it , struggling to stay upright and standing . Then he ($_midoriya) sees it . 
Maybe it 's his ($_midoriya) imagination -- there s shifting on a tree 15 feet to his ($_midoriya) left , almost a crawling motion , digits spidering their way across the trunk . Pale fingers 
A hand , but not attached to a body . 
He ($_midoriya) chokes back a muffled cry of horror , stumbling a step before turning and sprinting in the opposite direction . 
He ($_midoriya) runs from that evil aura , the emotions of hatred and vengeance and never-ending loneliness that threaten to swallow him ($_midoriya) whole . Midoriya ($_midoriya) is no expert on the_Spirit_World ($_the) , but he ($_midoriya) knows that that is not supposed to be there . He ($_midoriya) wheezes and weaves between trees , attempting to get away as fast as possible . 
The invading emotions slowly fade as he ($_midoriya) puts distance between him ($_midoriya) and the thing , to his ($_midoriya) relief . He ($_midoriya) slows down and leans against the thick trunk of a towering tree , trying to catch his ($_midoriya) breath . 
But a new sensation appears , less of a feeling and more of a magnetic pull . It 's the polar opposite of what he ($_midoriya) felt merely a few minutes ago : it 's hope , it 's reassurance and guidance . Midoriya ($_midoriya) straightens up , tiredly shuffling in what he ($_midoriya) thinks is the right direction . 
It is n't a far walk -- only about five minutes -- until he ($_midoriya) reaches the edge of the forest , the overhead canopy making way to purple blue sky and sloping green hills . Midoriya ($_midoriya) merely blinks slowly , until a voice calls his ($_midoriya) name somewhere to his ($_midoriya) left . 
He ($_midoriya) turns to see the former avatar , picking his ($_midoriya) way over tree roots towards him ($_midoriya) . 
Thank god . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) walks over to meet him ($_midoriya) , the_man ($_midoriya) s presence putting him ($_midoriya) at ease . 
You haven t been here in a while , my boy , All_Might ($_all) says , clapping Midoriya ($_midoriya) on the back like an old friend rather than some kid he s only met once . Troubles getting back to the Spirit World ? 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) shrinks . Yes It took me a bit to figure out how to get here , but I think I ve got it now . 
I m glad -- I ve got a feeling that there would have been trouble , had you learned any later . 
The_man ($_midoriya) gives him a small smile and a final back pat , then turning to sit on a raised tree root . He seems relaxed , nonchalant . 
But something in his words bother Midoriya ($_midoriya) . He hesitates , then asks . 
What do you mean by trouble ? 
All_Might ($_all) freezes , like he s been caught in some secret act . It ($_all) feels weird , pressing his childhood hero to share information with him , but Midoriya ($_midoriya) stays firm , fixing his mentor with a questioning stare . 
He has to familiarize himself with his past life . They have to be open with each other , and that connection starts with no secrets . 
Something in Midoriya ($_midoriya) s look must tell All_Might ($_all) this ; he sighs . 
Well , I suppose you would ve learned sooner or later , anyhow , All_Might ($_all) says , scooching to the left and patting the root next to him . Midoriya ($_midoriya) pauses , then walks over to sit . 
There s a moment of silence as All_Might ($_all) formulates what to say ; he fiddles those long fingers of his and stares straight ahead . Midoriya ($_midoriya) just watches his ($_midoriya) hands , letting the avatar think . 
The fingers stop promptly and Midoriya ($_midoriya) locks eyes with his mentor , now donning a grim expression . 
I ll cut to the chase : something dark is on the horizon , All_Might ($_all) says , black eyes boring into Midoriya ($_midoriya) s. For both your world and mine . 
What What is it ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) asks hesitantly . 
All_Might ($_all) sighs . I wish that I knew , my boy . 
Well , what makes you think that , then ? Have you been seeing something , had to fight someone ? 
All_Might ($_all) rises and stands in front of Midoriya ($_midoriya) , almost as if the very thought of evil on the horizon makes him restless . 
There 's a group -- a league , I should say -- that has been dabbling with affairs in both the human world and the_Spirit_World ($_the) . I 've spotted them a few times here , and some of my human correspondents in your realm have gotten glances , too . All Might scratches at the top of his head , staring off into the woods . They 're not sending people here so much as they are sending entities Always a cloud of dark mist or a hand 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) shudders and All_Might ($_all) stops . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) ? Did you see one of them ? 
The boy fidgets . Um, yes. He fiddles with his fingers , looking down at the ground . I thought I spotted a hand It felt like it was watching me . . And it was radiating these awful emotions 
All Might mutters curses under his breath , stepping forward to place a hand on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s shoulders . 
I m sorry you had to witness that , my boy . I would be lying if I told you I knew what that thing is up to -- but I can say this , he says , locking eyes with his successor . Don ($_don) t try to find out what it is . Not yet. 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) breathes sharply . But , All_Might ($_all) -- 
You re not ready to face off with whatever this is , he cuts Midoriya ($_midoriya) off . I understand you want to help , but for now the best thing you can do is lay low and train . You have a lot of missed time to make up for . 
He has a point -- what could Midoriya ($_midoriya) even do right now ? The boy slumps a little , the argument lost . 
Don ($_don) t worry , All_Might ($_all) says . It hasn t done anything too villainous , as of yet . Plus , I have contacts in the_real_world_that_are_trying_to_find_its_source ($_the) . We ll know what it is , soon enough . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) tenses at contacts , recalling what he came here to ask about . Uh , All Might , about the_real_world ($_the) 
You re not sure what you re supposed to be doing , right ? All_Might ($_all) responds . We re connected -- I can feel your confusion and apprehension towards the task at hand . 
The words stolen from his mouth , Midoriya ($_midoriya) freezes for a second , then nods weakly . He shrugs away from the avatar s grasp , rising from his seat and starting a nervous pace . 
I don t even know where to start , he mutters , hand on his chin as he walks back and forth . Do I just come out and announce it 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) . 
Or keep it quiet -- 
Breathe . 
Or just train in one element , or -- 
You re overthinking this , my boy . 
But am I ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) frantically shoots back , stopping in his ($_midoriya) tracks . 
All_Might ($_all) pauses , then belts out a laugh . 
It s contagious -- Midoriya ($_midoriya) can t help but crack into a smile , then a chuckle , and then a full laugh . 
They both laugh longer than the situation warrants , but when they finally stop , Midoriya ($_midoriya) feels more relaxed . Something about the avatar just calls for calm -- in the face of the daunting , he still manages to put on a smile . 
He wasn t the most charismatic avatar for nothing , Midoriya ($_midoriya) guesses . 
I m sorry to laugh , kid -- I m just very happy to see you so serious about this , All_Might ($_all) says , seating himself again . Okay , back to business . You know the traditional path an avatar takes . 
Yes : you re told of their role when you turn sixteen and then you embark on your journey to master the elements . You go in the order of the Avatar Cycle -- for me , that would be earth , fire , air , water , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says . But I ve already diverged from all of that . 
True , the former avatar agrees . You re making yourself out to be quite the nontraditional case . But that s okay . Some of the best avatars of the past have strayed from the tradition and turned out perfectly fine . 
Yeah , but I bet all of them were able to bend before they turned fourteen , Midoriya ($_midoriya) murmurs , earning a sad look from All_Might ($_all) . 
You can t dwell on that , Midoriya ($_midoriya) , the man says softly . You re a unique case . 
What did you say it was -- that my energy was blocked ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) questions . How did it suddenly get unblocked ? Why was it blocked in the first place ? 
Like I said earlier -- it was a combination of different factors : emotional stunting , insecurity , et cetera , All Might replies , shifting on his perch . He scratches the top of his head , looking somewhere off into the landscape behind Midoriya ($_midoriya) s shoulder . And -- er , this isn t for certain , but it may have also been my fault . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) tenses . What? 
The avatar sighs . My fight with All For One didn t just leave my body scarred . They tried to keep it from the public -- it would have sent everything into even more chaos , if they had -- but : there was a spiritual aspect to what the Rebellion was trying to accomplish , as well . 
All For One had two main goals : firstly , to gain control of Harmony ($_harmony) and , by extent , all four nations . But their second , more ominous goal , was crazy . Theoretically impossible. Unless , that is , you had a stable bridge to take you back and forth from the_Spirit_World ($_the) . 
He was interested in looking for bending energy sources in the Spirit World -- that is , places that could grant bending . I guess you could say he wanted to become a pseudo-avatar . 
It s faint -- a slight hesitancy to All Might s words , a tiny pause that drops like lead into Midoriya ($_midoriya) s stomach . 
Is he afraid ? 
In an instant , All_Might ($_all) suddenly seems so much smaller , so much more scared and lost and dead . 
Is this what s in store for me , too ? Or will it be worse ? 
He shudders as All_Might ($_all) begins to speak again . 
Now , whether places like that actually exist is entirely beyond my knowledge -- or if I could even take people with me when crossing worlds , but All For One wanted me to bring him to the Spirit World , regardless . And he was going to do it by force . 
So you weren t just fighting to stop them from taking Harmony ($_harmony) , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says . You were fighting to avoid being captured , too . 
All_Might ($_all) nods . And what a fight it ($_all) was . It ($_all) took everything I had to hold him at bay . I m guessing you already know this , but I had to go into the_Avatar_State ($_the) . No small feat , but it worked and I almost had him finished . But then I got hit . He grimaces at the memory , placing a hand over his concealed wound . I think that this was the first factor in blocking your energy . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) furrows his ($_midoriya) brow . But sustaining injuries in the Avatar State isn t enough to end the_Cycle ($_the) . Or block energy . 
You re right , the injury itself wasn t what did it , the man replies , with a hint of embarrassment ? Shame ? But after taking that hit , I was I didn t know if I would win , and I didn t want to be the one to end the_Cycle ($_the) . So I went out of the_State ($_the) for the rest of the fight . 
A lightbulb goes off in Midoriya ($_midoriya) s head . 
You were ashamed that you got scared for yourself , he states . And ashamed that you left the_State ($_the) , even though staying in it ($_the) could have ended the fight a lot sooner and saved more of the city . So you blocked a chakra point . 
All_Might ($_all) blinks . Er . Yes. It seems like you know something about chakras . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) flushes , waving his ($_midoriya) hands in apology . Oh , I m so sorry -- that was insensitive of me -- 
No , my boy , it s fine . All_Might ($_all) gives him ($_midoriya) a small smile . Butting your head into other people s business is the mark of a good avatar . And it s good to see you already know about your chakras -- those are important . 
The blood doesn t leave Midoriya ($_midoriya) s face , and he ($_midoriya) squeaks out a thank you . 
So yes , like you said , All_Might ($_all) starts again slowly . I didn t resolve my own emotional issues in my lifetime , and ended up clogging my fire chakra -- willpower , blocked by shame . 
But why would that block all of my bending ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) questions . 
Well -- my theory is that I didn t just have one chakra clogged . The man raises his right hand and points an index finger at his forehead . Thought chakra . Pure cosmic energy , blocked by worldly attachments . And I passed on with a lot of people that I wanted to save and a lot of people I wanted to bring to justice . 
And you think that carried over into my chakras , Midoriya ($_midoriya) concludes . 
I ll say that I was never quite as good at the whole spiritual aspect as some of the former avatars . So I don t know if my running theory actually works , All_Might ($_all) says . And while I ve come to terms with my fate and emotions , I had to fix the Thought Chakra in person -- but some sort of disconnect between us kept you from coming here for fourteen years . 
So that s what the whole forehead thing was last time , Midoriya ($_midoriya) thinks . But what kind of disconnect 
But what s important is that you re here now and you ve already bended two elements , All_Might ($_all) says , interrupting Midoriya ($_midoriya) s thoughts . You ve also attempted water and fire , correct ? 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) nods . But I wasn t able to do either . I can t really figure out what I should be feeling when I bend those . 
Don ($_don) t rush it , All_Might ($_all) advises . You ve only just entered the bending world , so start with earth , move to air , and then attempt the other two . Every avatar has an element they struggle with -- mine was fire . He looks Midoriya ($_midoriya) up and down . And I feel like yours will be , as well . 
How can you tell ? 
All Might tents his hands , fingertips on his lips . You ll find that most firebenders have found sources for their bending that are Self-destructive . Angry . Not the true essence of what firebending is intended to be . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) s brain spits out a mental picture of a snarling Kacchan , which he shoves down immediately . 
I feel as though you ve only ever witnessed that kind of firebending in your life . You might attempt to start off on the wrong foot , without the right master , he continues . And even then , it may take some time . The meanings of each element must be learned -- and as someone who s always been on the receiving end of an angry firebender , its meaning might not come easy . 
The knowing look All_Might ($_all) gives Midoriya ($_midoriya) tells him ($_midoriya) that he ($_midoriya) knows all about Bakugou . Midoriya ($_midoriya) returns a nervous smile . 
It will take time of course . I know you want to have a step-by-step plan , something to follow to the letter . But you must remember : a large aspect of being the avatar is following the flow of energy . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) must look confused , because the former avatar sighs . 
The flow -- whether it be in your bending , in conflicts , in your own life . You must learn to adapt accordingly and make split second decisions for the good of mankind , All_Might ($_all) says . While I am here to give you advice , I am not always going to be there when you need to make tough choices in the spur of the moment . 
The boy already knew all that , but something about All Might saying it aloud makes it more real . 
Your hardships and battles will be different than mine . You can not copy me -- that ll only end in tragedy . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) gazes up at his ($_midoriya) predecessor , the weight of his ($_midoriya) words settling on his ($_midoriya) shoulders . 
He ($_midoriya) can ask for guidance , but the final decisions will be up to him ($_midoriya) . 
He ($_midoriya) can save the world , but he ($_midoriya) might not be able to save himself ($_midoriya) . 
The nod of understanding he ($_midoriya) gives feels like the click of a lock on his ($_midoriya) heart . There s no backing out ; his ($_midoriya) fate is intertwined with that of the world . 
All_Might ($_all) responds with a grim smile . 
So tell me , the man says , rising and turning to thread his way into the shadows of the trees . Midoriya ($_midoriya) begins to follow , only to have the scenery around him flicker out like a lightbulb . He s once again in that black void , nothing but him , darkness , and the boom of his mentor s voice . 
What are you going to do ? 
He trains like hell . 
If he 's going to train under anyone , he needs to make sure that his bones do n't shatter first . 
His immediate goal : fortify his plans for the future , fortify his body , and fortify his mind . 
Step number one : build muscle , work on power output , and prep himself for the Yuuei ($_yuuei) entrance exam . 
He s been doing this for years -- fragmenting his long term goals into smaller ones , staving off the pressure of his future by compartmentalizing it . He ll still have to save the world someday , but for now he just has to focus on getting into Yuuei ($_yuuei) . 
As to why he 's so dead set on Yuuei ($_yuuei) ... it 's less of a specific reason and more of a feeling . 
Simply put , it feels like fate . 
-LRB- Midoriya ($_midoriya) ca n't deny that All Might attending the school in his ($_midoriya) youth plays a big factor in the magnetism of the school . -RRB- 
But the abundance of masters teaching there , the interdisciplinary focus in the bending , the probable contacts All_Might ($_all) has there -- it seems like a place specifically founded to groom avatars . 
So Yuuei it is . 
His ($_midoriya) life becomes a collage of bending matches , gyms , and the quiet lot behind his ($_midoriya) house . Anywhere where no one will stop him ($_midoriya) from practicing . When he ($_midoriya) s not in school , he ($_midoriya) s sweating -- pulling up rocks , seeing which moves work for him ($_midoriya) and which ones don t. 
The internet helps him ($_midoriya) more than he ($_midoriya) would like to admit . Step-by-step power position tutorials , workout regiments , bending match videos -- they re abundant and easily accessible , and Midoriya ($_midoriya) finds himself ($_midoriya) compiling all of their combined knowledge together until he ($_midoriya) has a semblance of an actual workout schedule . 
x
There are two aspects to the Yuuei practical exam : power and combat . Midoriya ($_midoriya) can learn combat moves by himself ($_midoriya) by watching pro matches -- but the power portion might prove to be a challenge , without direction . 
He ($_midoriya) can t figure out how to increase his ($_midoriya) power . He ($_midoriya) has a set limit , but honestly , it s not enough . 
But when your mentor was notoriously good at interdisciplinary bending and using all of his ($_midoriya) might in the fighting ring , it seems wasteful to just let that expertise slide . 
So Midoriya ($_midoriya) finds himself ($_midoriya) back in the Spirit World two weeks after their last encounter , luckily encountering no shadowy hands . 
He ($_midoriya) pitches his ($_midoriya) idea to All Might : teach Midoriya ($_midoriya) the motions and logistics of a power-maximizing earthbending move to help him ($_midoriya) pass the exam . 
The proposition brings a smile to All Might s face . He ($_midoriya) beams , then places a large hand on Midoriya ($_midoriya) s head . 
Don ($_don) t worry , he ($_midoriya) assures . I have just the move in mind . 
x
It s backbreaking work . Even sleep no longer offers a refuge , due to power sessions with All_Might ($_all) . 
School , combat training , power practice , repeat . The months fly by and Midoriya ($_midoriya) hardly notices . 
Of course there are moments when he doubts what he s doing -- is Yuuei ($_yuuei) actually worth this ? He s the avatar -- can t he put off the hellish training until later ? He s going to get a master no matter what , so why panic ? 
But as buzzes of the entrance exam begin to dance around the classroom , Midoriya ($_midoriya) is painfully reminded that this is him catching up . That what he s doing right now is making up for fourteen years of inactivity , fourteen years of missed bending experience . 
If he wants to train with the best , he has to put himself on equal footing first -- his spiritual title does not give him to a free ride to Yuuei . 
So despite his doubts , despite his fatigue , he pushes forward . He sees results . 
He s sturdier , in mind and in body . He has an artillery of combat actions at his disposal . He has an All Might specialty move , guaranteed to max his power output . 
When ten months are up and the exam looms over the horizon , Midoriya ($_midoriya) actually feels like he ($_midoriya) s standing at the starting line . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) shuffles past the Yuuei ($_yuuei) gates , his ($_midoriya) throat in his ($_midoriya) stomach and his ($_midoriya) legs trembling . 
He ($_midoriya) did okay on the written portion -- a lot of it was interdisciplinary bending logistics , the history of bending , and what-would-you-do scenarios . There were only one or two he ($_midoriya) didn t know at all , and a couple more he ($_midoriya) was hesitant about , but it seems likely he ($_midoriya) scored well . 
Now comes the tough part . 
He ($_midoriya) s forcing himself ($_midoriya) to be calm , clasping his ($_midoriya) hands together to stop their shaking and taking deep , controlled breaths . He ($_midoriya) closes his ($_midoriya) eyes . 
The worst that can happen is he ($_midoriya) has to go to another bending school . He ($_midoriya) s prepared for this . He ($_midoriya) s done as much as he ($_midoriya) can . It s all a matter of showing that work now . 
Slightly calmer , Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes flick back open . A small smile creeps onto his ($_midoriya) face and he ($_midoriya) takes a big step forward -- 
Directly into a rock jutting out of the pavement . 
He ($_midoriya) topples but his ($_midoriya) mind stays strangely clear . 
Of course , his ($_midoriya) brain sighs , resigned to its fate . Of COURSE you have to fall and break your arm right before the biggest exam of your life . You wouldn t be Midoriya Izuku if you didn t pull some clutzy move like this . So stupid. 
Right before he ($_midoriya) gets a faceful of asphalt , however , there s a whoosh and suddenly he ($_midoriya) isn t falling . 
In fact , he ($_midoriya) s floating . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes go wide and he ($_midoriya) yelps , scrambling to get upright . The air begins to assist him ($_midoriya) upwards , bringing him ($_midoriya) from 20 to 90 . His ($_midoriya) feet firmly planted on the ground again , Midoriya ($_midoriya) turns to find his ($_midoriya) savior . 
Are you okay ? A short girl with a gravity-defying bob smiles worriedly at him ($_midoriya) , arms still raised from bending . Her big brown eyes look him ($_midoriya) up and down , questioning and caring . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) merely stares . 
Sorry for not asking before using my bending on you , she continues , shifting her hands to grasp the strap of the satchel at her hip . I figured it would be bad luck to trip before the exam ! 
She tilts her head and beams . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) feels himself ($_midoriya) nearly go into cardiac arrest . 
Uh , he ($_midoriya) eloquently responds . 
Well , we better get inside -- they re starting soon . I m so nervous ! But let s both do our best , okay ? 
Um , he ($_midoriya) tries again . 
Good luck ! she says , turning to continue her way across the courtyard . Only his ($_midoriya) eyes follow , watching the swish of her yellow skirt as she climbs the stairs and vanishes inside the building . 
He ($_midoriya) doesn t think of how mortifying that was . He ($_midoriya) doesn t think of how experienced the benders he ($_midoriya) s up against must be , for that girl to pull such a controlled stunt with no prep . He ($_midoriya) doesn t even think about the dreaded exam . 
His ($_midoriya) brain simply spits out : 
I talked to a girl ! 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) stands there , beaming like an idiot , until someone bumps into his ($_midoriya) shoulder . 
Get moving , shitty Deku , they growl . 
It pulls him ($_midoriya) out of his ($_midoriya) reverie ; he ($_midoriya) jumps at the sight of Kacchan s red glare boring into him ($_midoriya) -- but is then subsequently confused when the other boy just keeps walking forward to the doors . 
No taunting . No teasing . Nothing . 
It s true that Bakugou ($_bakugou) had been a lot more reserved following the incident . Whereas previous help from Midoriya ($_midoriya) spurred on relentless insults , this_time_Bakugou ($_bakugou) seemed recoil from any contact at all . Is he ($_midoriya) ashamed ? Angry ? 
Either way , Midoriya ($_midoriya) finds that the lack of attention -- positive or negative -- is off-putting . It feels like Bakugou ($_bakugou) is plotting something . 
-LRB- Or that Bakugou ($_bakugou) thinks he ($_midoriya) s plotting something . -RRB- 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) tries to wipe that unease from his ($_midoriya) mind , changing his ($_midoriya) thoughts to the task ahead . He ($_midoriya) sighs , then follows his ($_midoriya) neighbor through those daunting doors . 
They re greeted by a towering stage , the seats layered around it packed and chatter bouncing off the walls . A quick pitstop at the check-in table and the bestowing of the testing pack and seating assignments for the info session , then the two deposit themselves in chairs further back than Midoriya ($_midoriya) would like . 
The silence from Bakugou ($_bakugou) is deafening ; they both quietly pin on their numbers and pull on their armbands , neither acknowledging the other s presence . 
The air is thick with tension , awkward shifting in seats and nervous gazes drifting over the throng of other students as they all await the test instructions . Some stretch in place , some control their breathing , and some just sit and stare . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) finds himself ($_midoriya) in the last category , trying to push down the trembling in his ($_midoriya) stomach as he ($_midoriya) watches the experienced motions and sculpted muscles of the others around him ($_midoriya) . 
What was he ($_midoriya) thinking ? He ($_midoriya) literally only learned how to earthbend -- what , ten months ago ? These kids have been bending their whole lives . Who was he ($_midoriya) to think that he ($_midoriya) could waltz in as some amateur and actually procure himself ($_midoriya) a spot in the top bending school in the city ? 
Stupid, stupid, stupid. 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) nervously adjusts the green armband on his ($_midoriya) forearm -- an earthbender . Just an earthbender . 
He ($_midoriya) needs to keep it that way . 
If people find out that he ($_midoriya) s the avatar , they also find out that All_Might ($_all) is dead . The fragile peace that All Might s image has upheld since the rebellion collapses , and he ($_midoriya) s forced to deal with the aftermath -- untrained . Imagine the sheer panic that would arise when people found out their current avatar wasn t even able to bend up until 10 months ago . 
He ($_midoriya) might consider telling some of the Yuuei ($_yuuei) staff if he ($_midoriya) actually gets in -- some of them might already know , even -- , but it s essential that he ($_midoriya) keep this secret until he ($_midoriya) s mastered Earth at least . 
Of course , he ($_midoriya) has to get into Yuuei ($_yuuei) first . 
His ($_midoriya) thoughts are interrupted when he ($_midoriya) notices what appears to be their instructor . 
A man in airbending reds and yellows takes to the stage , swaggering over to the podium and tapping at the mic a few times . He ($_midoriya) glances at some papers laid out in front of him ($_midoriya) , then looks up at the crowd of students ahead . He ($_midoriya) uses one hand to slick his ($_midoriya) pointy yellow hair back , and the other to read whatever is written on his ($_midoriya) notes . 
When he ($_midoriya) s done , he ($_midoriya) looks up , smiles , and then shouts . 
HOW S IT GOIN , PROSPECTIVE YUUEI STUDENTS ? 
The students all slam their hands over their ears , the mic turned up way too high for someone who is obviously naturally pretty loud . 
The_man ($_midoriya) glances at someone at the back of the stage , pulling his ($_midoriya) mouth away from the mic . 
What -- you want me to ? He ($_midoriya) gestures at the mic , then at himself ($_midoriya) . More gesticulating , then a look of understanding . Oh , you want me to not use the mic ? Okay , that s cool . That s fair . 
He ($_midoriya) steps away from the podium , then starts again . 
Sorry for that . Good morning , examinees ! I hope you re ready to TEST ! 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) gasps with recognition , clapping a hand over his ($_midoriya) mouth . 
That s -- that s Yamada Hizashi ! Present Mic ! he ($_midoriya) whispers excitedly . Bending match announcer and pro airbender for the -- 
Stop fangirling and fucking pay attention , dipshit , Bakugou ($_bakugou) growls . Midoriya ($_midoriya) shuts up instantly , but a smile still tugs at the corners of his ($_midoriya) mouth . 
Let s get right to it ! As you all know , Yuuei ($_yuuei) is a multi-disciplinary combat school with a focus on bending and fighting s active use in careers , Yamada ($_yamada) says , gesturing at the Jumbotron behind him ($_yamada) as it blinks from the school logo to the number 2 . He ($_yamada) , in turn , raises two fingers . That s why we ll be testing you on two different aspects : power and combat . 
# 1 , the jumbotron reads . Power . 
First , we have to gage how much power you can put into your bending , Yamada ($_yamada) explains . We need to have you at a certain caliber of bending before we can do any work with you . Airbenders will go for speed , firebenders for distance and heat , waterbenders for distance , and earthbenders for height . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) looks down at the table in front of him ($_midoriya) . Yeah , he ($_midoriya) s been working on his ($_midoriya) power output through his ($_midoriya) sessions with All_Might ($_all) , but he ($_midoriya) isn t sure how that will stack up against the other benders here . He ($_midoriya) ll just have to do his ($_midoriya) best . 
Remember : power comes from many different sources in bending , Yamada ($_yamada) says , almost as a side-note . There s sheer power , there s technical power -- we don t care whichever one you use , as long as your output is good . 
# 2 : Combat . 
And here s the fun part -- the combat , the_man ($_midoriya) says with a devious grin . Midoriya ($_midoriya) gulps . 
We have multiple bending rings set up , each with their own stationed team , Yamada ($_yamada) says , waving a hand at an animated fighting ring behind him ($_yamada) . We ve assigned you into teams of four . Your task is simple : beat the other team . 
A murmur goes across the room , students glancing at one another . 
Now , just beating the other team isn t gon na be enough to pass , of course . We re grading you on a multitude of other things . But I ll tell you this : the more hits you get on the other team , the better . You don t want to be a bystander for this test . 
You ll get more info on the combat portion right before you fight , Yamada ($_yamada) says . But for now : go show us some power ! 
His ($_yamada) following wink rallies the students ; there s a burst in noise from the crowd , with students vying to escape their seats and get to the testing sites first . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) follows hesitantly behind them , the reality of his ($_midoriya) competition now dawning on him ($_midoriya) . 
x
They re broken into groups and taken down to different testing sites . He ($_midoriya) and Bakugou ($_bakugou) are separated -LRB- thank god -RRB- , and he ($_midoriya) doesn t bother mingling with the other examinees as they walk out onto the field -- he ($_midoriya) doesn t think his ($_midoriya) stomach could take it . 
It s a typical green field , but with a painted white line differentiating the testing zone from the observation zone . The students amass right on the line . 
He ($_midoriya) edges his ($_midoriya) way to the front of the crowd , opting to fight his ($_midoriya) nervousness by observing other students tests . As he ($_midoriya) waits for the test to begin , someone chimes right next to him ($_midoriya) . 
You made it ! 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) looks to his ($_midoriya) left to see his ($_midoriya) savior from earlier : the airbending girl . Somehow , they ended up in the same testing group -- Midoriya ($_midoriya) isn t sure whether he ($_midoriya) s happy or sad about that . He ($_midoriya) fidgets . 
U-uh . Yep 
She looks a little more serious from earlier , the smile she returns not making it all the way to her eyes . She must be nervous , too . 
Well , good luck ! Without another word , she goes back to watching the field . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) is grateful for her not wanting to small-talk -- he ($_midoriya) would puke . 
The proctor makes his way into the testing zone , scanning a clipboard . All right , he begins . First , students here based on recommendation . Line up . 
A group of six students step forward , their only notable difference from the other examinees being a secondary golden arm band . 
They represent all four elements , but they all have an air of confidence around themselves -- majority of them are guaranteed a spot at the school , whether it be due to money , ability , or both . 
Whereas Midoriya ($_midoriya) had to fight just to stand at the starting line with everyone else , these people are already leagues ahead of him ($_midoriya) . 
Their following displays are appropriately fantastic : a girl launches a water whip at break-neck speeds , some boy forces a column of rock at least three stories high . 
But the test that catches everyone s attention is a boy with strange white and red hair . 
As he ($_midoriya) takes to the field , something about him ($_midoriya) seems familiar -- his ($_midoriya) hair ? The dignity he ($_midoriya) carries himself ($_midoriya) with ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) can t see his ($_midoriya) face , but he ($_midoriya) knows he ($_midoriya) s seen this kid before . 
The_examinee ($_midoriya) seems to have tuned the rest of the world out . As soon as he ($_midoriya) s given the go ahead , he ($_midoriya) swirls his ($_midoriya) arms in a loose circle , wrists twisting and elegantly pulling and pushing . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) ca n't help but be entranced by the display ; they 're the moves of an experienced waterbender , but something looks off -- instead of the calmness and patience of typical waterbending , the motions look borderline angry , fast and sometimes even jagged . 
The boy s palms spark . 
With a sharp jump and thrust , a jet of flames erupts from his hands , leaving a charred line of grass half a football field long . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) flinches . 
His eyes finally drift down to the boy s armband : red . Fire Nation . But what kind of bending was that ? It was more waterbending than firebending -- and in a test where you re try to maximize power output , you definitely want to draw more on firebending technique . 
The boy looks unfazed , merely straightening up and relaxing with an indifferent expression . It s not until he turns to face the rest of the group that Midoriya ($_midoriya) spots the mass of red puckered flesh on his left eye and things click together . 
A scar . Strangely colored hair . Calm , removed . Firebending that looks like waterbending . 
That s . 
That s . 
Hey , um , the airbender girl says from beside him . You re kind of staring . At Todoroki Shouto . Y know . The Firelord s son . The one that hates staring . 
At the sound of his name , the prince turns and locks eyes with him . Midoriya ($_midoriya) snaps out of his ($_midoriya) trance , jerking to attention and whipping his ($_midoriya) head to the side in a TOTALLY subtle attempt to play it off . 
W-was I ? he ($_midoriya) nervously asks , eyes jumping across the backs of other testers , at the buildings -- anywhere but Todoroki ($_todoroki) . Haha , oops 
The girl starts laughing , to which a nearby boy almost immediately chimes in to tell her that laughing during an exam is disrespectful , and she ought to be ashamed , and if she aims to be a top bender , she should be paying extremely close attention , and a million other things that Midoriya tunes out . When he ($_midoriya) gages it s been long enough , he ($_midoriya) shyly peeks at the prince again . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) s mismatched eyes are still trained on him ($_midoriya) , the quiet intensity of his ($_midoriya) gaze making Midoriya ($_midoriya) fidget . It ($_todoroki) feels like he ($_midoriya) s being analyzed -- like this boy is sinking under his ($_midoriya) skin and paging through his ($_midoriya) weaknesses and secrets . 
It s scary . 
The prince finally looks away and Midoriya ($_midoriya) releases a breath he ($_midoriya) didn t know he ($_midoriya) was holding . 
Can I go ? Todoroki ($_todoroki) asks , turning to the test proctor . I ve done my required testing . 
I m afraid not , Your Highness , the proctor says . You have to stay here until all examinees have finished the power gaging portion of the exam . I m sorry for all the formalities , but -- well , rules are rules . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) sighs , then calmly moves his way off the testing lawn and into the crowd . He accidentally bumps into the next recommendee in line , a buzzcut-headed airbender , but doesn t apologize and keeps moving . The airbender side-eyes him before stepping up to test . 
The prince looks robotic . Icy . Not anything like what would be expected of the Firelord s son . 
What happened to him ? What must his home life be like , to make him that cold ? 
But Midoriya ($_midoriya) is brought back to his ($_midoriya) current predicament when the airbender spontaneously unleashes a tornado on the testing field , ripping up the grass and unrooting nearby bushes . Oh, right. He ($_midoriya) has to go up against that . 
He ($_midoriya) twitches in place as the proctor tells the boy to contain the storm and go back into the crowd . 
That concludes the recommendee testing , the proctor says . Now we ll move on to standard testing -- and I must remind recommendees that they re to stay put for this portion , as well . He ($_midoriya) glances at Todoroki , who has melted somewhere into the back of the crowd . 
Everyone , please section off into your respective elements . 
With a shy smile , he ($_midoriya) and the airbending girls part ways . The proctor announces the order of elements : water , earth , fire , air . 
The following displays aren t as intimidating as the recommendees , but they still put Midoriya ($_midoriya) on edge . The waterbenders move the water like extensions of their own bodies , nonchalantly blasting streams across the field . 
When they move onto earthbending , Midoriya ($_midoriya) starts feeling intimidated . 
Yes , Midoriya ($_midoriya) has put on weight and packed on muscle . But he s still a shrimp compared to some of the muscles he sees on his fellow earthbenders . Sculpted calves , broad backs , and flat pecs -- Midoriya ($_midoriya) feels like he accidentally signed up for a bodybuilding show that he was horribly unprepared for . 
But All Might s advice comes to mind . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) , there s a misconception about earthbending that you ($_midoriya) re fixated on , he remembers All Might telling him one session when he was getting particularly frustrated with the move . 
Know this : muscle mass does not equate to power . 
No , power in bending comes from the strength of your ($_midoriya) own internal energy -- your ($_midoriya) body must be able to hold that power , of course , but your ($_midoriya) main focus should be keeping that energy strong and pure when you ($_midoriya) push it into the elements . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) breathes deeply . Focus on himself ($_midoriya) . Focus on doing the move right . He ($_midoriya) almost doesn t notice the test in front of him ($_midoriya) has finished . 
The proctor pauses for a moment before reading the next name . 
Midoriya_Izuku ($_midoriya) . 
He ($_midoriya) jumps at the sound of his ($_midoriya) name , then begins to edge his ($_midoriya) way through the crowd with slumped shoulders . 
The prolonged look the proctor gives him ($_midoriya) feels too significant to ignore -- does he ($_midoriya) knows ? Does everyone in Yuuei know ? He ($_midoriya) swallows hard , then assumes his ($_midoriya) power stance . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) gazes down at his ($_midoriya) hands , trying to calm his ($_midoriya) heartbeat and praying he ($_midoriya) s not about to do something that isn t earthbending . 
Whenever you re ready , Midoriya ($_midoriya) , the proctor says , making the boy flinch . 
Okay , Midoriya ($_midoriya) : remember your training . You worked with All_Might ($_all) on this -- you should have this in the bag . He shifts , steadying his feet and shifting his weight into his heels . This is the easy part . 
A deep breath . 
Then he begins . 
The move is awkward and more handsy than normal earthbending -- in a slow and deliberate movement , Midoriya ($_midoriya) moves his ($_midoriya) arms upwards from his ($_midoriya) core and out in a circle . His ($_midoriya) hands meet at the top ; he ($_midoriya) calmly lowers them , clasped over his ($_midoriya) heart . 
Draw power from your core , he ($_midoriya) hears All Might say . Bring your heart s energy into your hands , then out through your feet and into the ground . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) imagines that energy transfer , sees his ($_midoriya) power bleed out of his ($_midoriya) chest and into his ($_midoriya) hands . 
Down and steady , my boy . 
His ($_midoriya) hands move lower towards the ground , dragging the energy into the earth below . 
And� Now! 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) thrusts his ($_midoriya) hands skyward in a singular decisive movement , the ground following the motion . He ($_midoriya) holds it , waits for the rumbling above to halt . And then he ($_midoriya) breaks stance , oddly drained after the display . 
He ($_midoriya) cranes his ($_midoriya) head upwards , panting . It rivals the earthbending he ($_midoriya) s seen thus far -- it might even be higher . 
But the important thing is that he ($_midoriya) actually did it . 
He ($_midoriya) actually correctly did the move All_Might ($_all) taught him ($_midoriya) . 
He ($_midoriya) exits the bending zone with a small smile on his ($_midoriya) face , bubbling with internal pride . It makes him ($_midoriya) feel slightly better about the next portion of the exam -- at least he ($_midoriya) performed well on one half of the practical . He ($_midoriya) settles into the crowd , content to silently watch the next bending feats . 
Hey. 
It s a hollow voice , cool and controlled . Midoriya ($_midoriya) turns to look at the speaker , ready to greet them in turn . 
He ($_midoriya) flinches when he ($_midoriya) sees it s none other than the Fire Nation Prince , Todoroki_Shouto ($_todoroki) . 
-LRB- Is he ($_midoriya) supposed to bow ? Prostrate on the floor and kiss his ($_midoriya) shoes ? Oh god what is he ($_midoriya) supposed to do . -RRB- 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) instead opts to blink at the other boy , lost for words . Todoroki ($_todoroki) must be used to awed silence -- he ($_midoriya) speaks in Midoriya ($_midoriya) s stead . 
That was an All Might specialty move , the prince states , unwavering . 
Um. Y-yes ? Midoriya ($_midoriya) says . 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) does nothing but continue to stare and Midoriya ($_midoriya) mentally slaps himself for forgetting . 
Oh god , I mean -- yes , Your Highness , Midoriya ($_midoriya) backtracks , face suddenly hot and palms uncomfortably sweaty . I admired -- 
Don t call me that , Todoroki ($_todoroki) objects . Please. I can t stand it when people associate me with my jerk of a father . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) reels at the nonchalant insult -- of course , there were rumors that the heir didn t get along with the Firelord , but to be so open about it . 
Todoroki_Shouto ($_todoroki) must truly not care about family image . 
Okay�. Todoroki ($_todoroki) Todoroki_,_Midoriya ($_midoriya) stammers . But , um , yes , I admired All_Might ($_all) a lot as a kid , and I picked up a lot of his bending tricks from watching his matches . 
That one stunt combines aspects of firebending with a basic earthbending move in order to amplify power output , Todoroki ($_todoroki) says without missing a beat . It s supposed to take years to master -- they say you can only learn it at Yuuei or from All Might himself . 
Is it hot out here ? Or is it just Midoriya ($_midoriya) ? God , it s boiling . 
Haha , I m so dead . 
I. Well . Hm , Midoriya ($_midoriya) stammers , pulling at his ($_midoriya) collar and cringing under Todoroki ($_todoroki) s steady gaze . I guess ... I m just a quick learner ? 
Todoroki ($_todoroki) doesn t move and Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes flick around the surrounding crowd , desperately avoiding eye contact . The sensation of his ($_midoriya) skin being peeled back by the prince s gaze has now amplified into the feeling of his ($_midoriya) skin being flayed . It takes all of his ($_midoriya) willpower to avoid scampering off . 
... Sure , Todoroki says finally in the voice of someone utterly unconvinced . He ($_midoriya) scans Midoriya ($_midoriya) one more time , then turns without comment and walks back into the crowd . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) resists the urge to start hyperventilating . 
He ($_midoriya) gets the sense that he ($_midoriya) just had a very close call , even though there s no way in hell that Todoroki ($_todoroki) could have known anything about some common Earth Kingdom kid like him ($_midoriya) . It was the sheer speculative power of the prince alone that nearly blew his cover -- that , and Midoriya ($_midoriya) s horrendous ability to keep secrets . 
If he ($_midoriya) actually gets into Yuuei ($_yuuei) , he ($_midoriya) ll have to watch himself ($_midoriya) around the heir . 
He ($_midoriya) watches the rest of the examinees in a daze . It s one amazing performance after the next -- they blend together in his ($_midoriya) mind and he ($_midoriya) finds himself ($_midoriya) both intimidated and inspired . 
This is what he ($_midoriya) could be if he ($_midoriya) gets into Yuuei ($_yuuei) . 
This is the power he ($_midoriya) could practice beside , the people he ($_midoriya) could befriend . 
-LRB- He ($_midoriya) tries to ignore the sensation of mismatched , suspicious eyes attached to his ($_midoriya) back . -RRB- 
When the final test is complete , the proctor calls for them to gather into their respective elemental groups and to head inside -- further instructions will be provided there . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) leaves the field , a sense of foreboding lodging itself in his ($_midoriya) stomach . 
x
When he ($_midoriya) finds out the second portion of the match involves them wearing pro-bending uniforms , it s simultaneously a nightmare and a dream-come-true . 
He ($_midoriya) stands in front of the strewn out clothes , knowing he ($_midoriya) needs to dress fast but taking his ($_midoriya) time regardless . How many times has he ($_midoriya) wanted to do this ? To wear these uniforms , to fight in the pro-bending ring ? 
But he ($_midoriya) finds he ($_midoriya) can t get any pleasure from it right now -- the stakes are too high . 
The rules of the match echo through his ($_midoriya) head as he ($_midoriya) pulls off his ($_midoriya) own sweats and picks up the black shirt and pants . 
This won t be your normal pro-bending match , with rounds and territory gains , Yamada shares , seated backwards in a chair in the small classroom . He ($_midoriya) looks far too casual for something that will make or break Midoriya s future . 
Instead , it s one 5-minute round , with your sole objective being to push the other team off the back . 
The padded underclothes are tight and restrictive ; Midoriya ($_midoriya) yanks them on and wishes he ($_midoriya) had asked for a size up . He ($_midoriya) s grown more than he ($_midoriya) thought he ($_midoriya) had . 
The bare minimum to pass is KO ing the other team . Individual scoring is based on how many hits on your opponents you each make . 
He ($_midoriya) shrugs the thick padding on over his ($_midoriya) shoulders , yanks the green sash around his ($_midoriya) waist tighter , and deposits the helmet on his ($_midoriya) head . He ($_midoriya) exits the room , swerving a left and going to the entry hall . 
You ll want to keep as many of your teammates in the ring as you can , while also getting in as many hits on the enemy as possible . 
The lights of the arena are blinding ; he ($_bakugou) squints as he ($_bakugou) stumbles his ($_bakugou) way into the ring . He ($_bakugou) pays no mind to his ($_bakugou) teammates , solely focused on calming himself ($_bakugou) down before the match . 
If you fall out of the ring , you fail . 
He ($_bakugou) closes his ($_bakugou) eyes and inhales deeply . This is it . 
Some voice in the back of his ($_bakugou) head prompts him ($_bakugou) to wonder how Bakugou ($_bakugou) is faring in all of this -- but considering this is Bakugou he ($_bakugou) s thinking about , there s no reason to be worried . 
He ($_bakugou) needs to focus on himself ($_bakugou) . 
Hi again! 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) jumps at the cheery voice interrupting his ($_midoriya) thoughts , then flushes when he ($_midoriya) spots the speaker : pixie bob girl . 
Looks like we re on the same team , huh ? she notes , eyes skimming over Midoriya ($_midoriya) , then the other two team members behind him ($_bakugou) . The other two don t seem to be terribly friendly . The waterbender glared at me when I tried to talk to him ($_bakugou) and the firebender was a little zoned out . I don t think they re into the whole teamwork thing , y know ? 
Uh-huyeah , Midoriya ($_midoriya) says , internally slapping himself ($_midoriya) for the mix of gibberish he ($_midoriya) can t help but spew . 
Luckily , the girl doesn t seem to mind . Maybe she s used to it . Oh well , I guess we ll just have to watch each others backs . I m Uraraka ($_uraraka) , by the way ! 
Uraraka ($_uraraka) : bright , beautiful . How fitting. 
M-Midoriya ($_m-midoriya) , he ($_m-midoriya) replies . 
Nice to meet ya , Midoriya ($_midoriya) ! She drops her helmet on her head , gives him ($_m-midoriya) a final smile and thumbs up , then paces ahead of him ($_m-midoriya) to the middle line . 
Well , at least that s one advantage . Uraraka ($_uraraka) seems to be a pretty experienced bender -- even if airbending isn t terribly offensive , she ll still cover for him ($_m-midoriya) . 
It s a small comfort but a comfort nonetheless ; he ($_m-midoriya) joins his ($_m-midoriya) team at the start point . 
The following information the referee spits out sound like meaningless garble in his ears . Not that it matters -- he already knows the rules by heart . Instead , he takes the time to focus himself , to peek glances at his opponents and teammates . 
The other team is just as terrifying as he anticipated . He s not sure if they re Yuuei students or hired benders , but they re older and hardened . They look sure of themselves and their bending , and face the prospective students with countenances of grim determination . 
His team is not quite so confident . Like Uraraka ($_uraraka) said , the firebender looks dazed and confused . The waterbender looks near murderous . 
But the face that scares him the most is Uraraka s. Gone is her cheery disposition and airy smile ; instead , all he sees is icy willpower . Her eyes pick apart the other team as well , dancing over their arms and legs and gauging their faces . 
This girl means business . 
Rather than put him at ease , it disorients him further -- he s not the only one desperate to get in here . Is sabotage an option in this match ? What if she steals points from him ? 
Quit it , quit it , quit it ! He scolds himself internally , too lost in thought to notice the teams slowly edging towards their back boundaries and the ref raising a pointed hand . 
There s literally no logic in Uraraka ($_uraraka) trying to beat you ! You re on the same team , you both have to survive ! Regardless , you ll get enough points anyway , you ve done the work and -- 
-- riya ! 
He startles , whipping around to see Uraraka ($_uraraka) shouting at him . 
They re about to start ! 
He stumbles into Zone_1 ($_1) and tries to sink into fighting position when a sharp voice booms overhead . Midoriya ($_midoriya) looks upwards , pupils shrinking in shock . 
... 2 , 1 : GO . 
He doesn t even have time to blink before something solid thumps into his stomach , sending him tumbling backwards and into Zone_2 ($_2) . He wheezes a curse under his breath and then hauls himself to his feet , scanning the scene ahead . 
The match can only have been going on for ten seconds , but it s already sheer chaos . The arena is a multitude of one-on-one battles : his waterbender is trying to get a blow on the opposing airbender , their firebender is being relentlessly pelted with stone disks -- she s already in Zone 3 , yikes -- , and Uraraka ($_uraraka) is cartwheeling across Zone_1 ($_1) to avoid fire blasts . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) raises a disk and angles it to hit the enemy earthbender , but then he ($_midoriya) realizes . 
Wait. 
... Where s their waterbender ? 
The answer comes with a jet of water to the stomach . He ($_midoriya) lands on his ($_midoriya) butt but then uses his ($_midoriya) ground contact to his ($_midoriya) advantage , shooting out energy through the floor and calling for a nearby stone disk . The disk soars to his ($_midoriya) hands , which he ($_midoriya) then wields as a makeshift shield against the water strikes . The gaping hole in the middle means it doesn t offer as much protection as he ($_midoriya) d like , but it s all that he ($_midoriya) s got . 
The blasts come in one-second intervals and with all the force of a train ; he ($_midoriya) peeks from around the side of his ($_midoriya) blockade to see the waterbender , at the edge of his ($_midoriya) Zone 1 and with firmly planted feet . 
Okay -- he ($_midoriya) has to somehow distract the waterbender to keep from getting blasted , then aim a disk at him ($_midoriya) to score a point . But how? 
His ($_midoriya) eyes leap across the field , settling on the duel between his ($_midoriya) team s waterbender and the enemy airbender . That fight is almost over -- one more hit on the airbender and she ll be off the back . 
Time for a risk . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) waits for a water-free moment , then flings his ($_midoriya) shield as hard as possible at the airbender . 
It doesn t connect , but it disorients her ; taking advantage of the distraction , his ($_midoriya) team s waterbender propels a column of water towards the enemy that hits her dead-on . She soars to the back of the arena and over the edge . 
Nice. One enemy down and one teammate free to assist . 
He ($_midoriya) gets pelted with water again -- but with nothing free to block it , the force pushes him ($_midoriya) uncomfortably close to the Zone 3 line . Gritting his ($_midoriya) teeth , he ($_midoriya) leans into the stream so he ($_midoriya) s on his ($_midoriya) hands and knees . 
As soon as the water lets up , he ($_midoriya) leaps upright , stomping the ground and summoning another disk from the ground . He ($_midoriya) ll have to make this fast . 
He ($_midoriya) keeps up the disk s momentum with his ($_midoriya) arms , flinging the rock and his ($_midoriya) energy directly at the waterbender , poised for a direct hit and his ($_midoriya) first point -- 
Water makes it to the enemy first , slamming into him ($_midoriya) and pushing him ($_midoriya) into Zone_2 ($_2) . Midoriya ($_midoriya) s disk whizzes overhead and out of the ring . Midoriya ($_midoriya) drops his ($_midoriya) arms and cranes his ($_midoriya) head to look at the water s source . 
His ($_midoriya) teammate , wheeling his ($_midoriya) arms and prepping another water blast , doesn t even look at him ($_midoriya) as he ($_midoriya) shoots the enemy waterbender off the back and out of the ring . So much for teamwork . 
-LRB- They only have two enemies left now , but Midoriya ($_midoriya) finds he ($_midoriya) can t be happy about it . -RRB- 
A glance at the clock : 2 minutes left . 
Holy crap , only two minutes left already ? He ($_midoriya) still doesn t have any points ! Who�s even left to hit? 
Their firebender must have been knocked out -- she s nowhere to be seen . But the odds are still in their favor : three versus two . 
Uraraka ($_uraraka) is now engaged with the earthbender -- she s struggling , but she s staying put in Zone_1 ($_1) . The firebender stands in the middle of Zone_2 ($_2) , looking to pick a fight . 
Okay , there s Midoriya ($_midoriya) s target . 
The firebender , however , notices him ($_midoriya) first : she volleys off a round of fireballs right at him ($_midoriya) . He ($_midoriya) s forced to roll to the side . He ($_midoriya) pushes onto his ($_midoriya) feet and breaks into a run when the fire keeps coming . 
He ($_midoriya) s only done defense so far -- but what else can he ($_midoriya) do ? How can he ($_midoriya) fight when the enemy won t even let him ($_midoriya) plant himself ($_midoriya) and utilize his ($_midoriya) bending ? 
Nearing the edge of the Zone 2 and Uraraka ($_uraraka) s fight , he ($_midoriya) has no choice but to turn around and backtrack -- he ($_midoriya) s going to get hit . 
Unless he ($_midoriya) gets a distraction . 
Uraraka ($_uraraka) ! Midoriya ($_midoriya) shouts , praying that she ll be able to spare a moment . Some air , please ! 
She jerks at her name , looking towards Midoriya ($_midoriya) and narrowly sidestepping an oncoming earth disk from her opponent . Her gaze jumps over his fight , and then a spark of understanding leaps into her eyes . She nods . 
Whole arms twisting in a full-body circle , she inhales deeply and holds . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) shifts his ($_midoriya) core to head back in the direction he ($_midoriya) came from . 
Uraraka ($_uraraka) exhales and hell breaks loose . 
Something resembling a tornado erupts from her , spiraling towards the enemy firebender and redirecting her fireballs into a now fiery vortex . Eyes wide under her helmet , the opponent runs into Zone_3 ($_3) to dodge it ($_3) . 
Now! Now Midoriya ($_midoriya) can go for the hit . He ($_midoriya) plants himself ($_midoriya) , raising a disk . 
But before he ($_midoriya) can even aim it ($_3) , the wind catches up to the firebender . She soars upwards , then off the edge and into the watery pit below along with the tornado . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) stares , desperation clawing at his ($_midoriya) core . 
One hit ! he ($_midoriya) cries in frustration . I just need one hit ! 
He ($_midoriya) looks dully at the scene ahead -- there s just one more person to score hits on , and Uraraka ($_uraraka) seems to have that fight on lock . Or maybe the waterbender will try to snatch points from him ($_midoriya) again , if he ($_midoriya) s still here . 
Turning around , however , the waterbender is nowhere to be found . It looks like it s just him ($_midoriya) and Uraraka ($_uraraka) . But she s more than capable -- if he ($_midoriya) tried to interfere , he ($_midoriya) d probably just mess her up . 
There s a dull thud and someone yelps . Midoriya ($_midoriya) whips around to see Uraraka ($_uraraka) pinned under an earth disk , the opposing team s earthbender stalking over . He ($_midoriya) gives a harsh stomp and a disk slides under his ($_midoriya) captive , the sharp motion making her wheeze . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes flit over to the clock : 30 seconds . 30 seconds until they win . 
However , if Uraraka ($_uraraka) gets knocked out of the ring and it s just him ($_uraraka) and this_other_guy ($_midoriya) left Then they ($_midoriya) have to face off in a tiebreaker . 
Which , yes , is an opportunity for actual points , if Midoriya ($_midoriya) wins . 
But it also means that Uraraka ($_uraraka) fails . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) thrusts his ($_midoriya) hands upwards and raises a disk from the ground . He ($_midoriya) repeats the motion again , and again , and again until he ($_midoriya) has a 10-foot stack of disks hovering directly in front of him ($_midoriya) . He ($_midoriya) grunts under the strain , legs screaming in protest , but he ($_midoriya) manages to stay upright . 
Meanwhile , the enemy is in position , arms pushing out from his body in a fluid gesture and sending Uraraka ($_uraraka) s rock coffin hurtling towards the edge -- 
With a guttural yell , Midoriya ($_midoriya) slams both his ($_midoriya) fists into the side of the stack and sends it flying at the opponent . The_guy ($_midoriya) looks up in time for it ($_midoriya) to pummel into him ($_midoriya) , rocketing him ($_midoriya) away from Uraraka ($_uraraka) and towards the opposite edge . 
The impact from the blow sends a shudder up both of Midoriya ($_midoriya) s arms and he swears he can feel them fracture in at least five different places . 
His arms become pure , unadulterated pain . 
He collapses . 
Everything seems hazy as he watches his missile erupt into a billowing cloud of dust , watches the enemy emerge dirty but unscathed . The man lifts his hands and Midoriya ($_midoriya) feels a disk slide under him and two disks rise to box him in on both sides , sending a new wave of searing heat through his arms . 
He can t move . 
His surroundings are shifting ; he s speeding towards the edge and he s accepted that there s nothing he can do , that his exam is over . 
He clears the side and hangs in the great open space , right before that 20 foot plunge into icy water below -- 
But gravity never kicks in . 
He simply floats there , 20 feet above failure . And then he realizes . 
He lolls his head to the side and spots Uraraka ($_uraraka) , lower half still trapped in earth disks but right wrist frantically twisting to keep him up . The earthbender is nowhere to be seen . 
She adds her left arm to the movement , circling her hands over each other and towards herself , and Midoriya ($_midoriya) feels himself ($_midoriya) begin to drift back . 
When the ground is finally below him ($_midoriya) , Uraraka ($_uraraka) stops bending . Midoriya ($_midoriya) drops the 3 feet to the floor and gives a weak croak of protest on impact . His ($_midoriya) eyes drift to the clock in time to see big flashing zeroes -- 
Aaaaaand your exam is over ! Yamada yells over the intercom . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) blinks . 
All that training . All that work . And:
I got one hit . Just one hit , Midoriya ($_midoriya) moans , dropping his ($_midoriya) head to the ground . What kind of a bender am I 
There s something wet on his ($_midoriya) cheek and he ($_midoriya) closes his ($_midoriya) eyes , trying to tune out the irrepressible pain shooting up his ($_midoriya) arms . It seeps into his ($_midoriya) brain , clouding his ($_midoriya) thoughts , and he ($_midoriya) fights to stay awake . 
... him ($_midoriya) to the healers , now ! 
One hit . 
... what was that stunt 
One hit . 
... sure she s okay , get her a bag . 
One hit . 
The acrid smell of vomit reaches his ($_midoriya) nose and everything is overwhelming -- the noises are overwhelming and his ($_midoriya) thoughts are overwhelming and the pain is overwhelming . 
... he ($_midoriya) s repeating one hit , why . 
I failed . 
His ($_midoriya) brain flickers off . 
He ($_midoriya) doesn t eat much those next few days . 
His ($_midoriya) arms are healed , layers of bandages and worried looks from his ($_midoriya) mother the only evidence that anything happened . 
But the events of the exam plague his ($_midoriya) mind , looping over and over as he ($_midoriya) tries to settle back into normalcy , as he ($_midoriya) tries to come to terms with what just happened and what to do next . 
He ($_midoriya) s not going to Yuuei . That much seems obvious . 
Sure , he ($_midoriya) stayed in the ring but no way that was enough to get him ($_midoriya) into the school , not when others were scoring hits by the hundreds . 
Bakugou ($_bakugou) got in Midoriya ($_midoriya) doesn t have to speculate on that . He ($_bakugou) s dreading seeing the smug look on his ($_bakugou) face in class the day after they find out , feels nauseous thinking about facing the class when they knew what would happen the whole time . 
Maybe Uraraka ($_uraraka) got in . Maybe she ll remember that silly earthbending kid that couldn t even score a hit , take pity and call to hang out sometime . Maybe some good will actually come out of the exam . 
He ($_bakugou) sits on the couch , squeezing a weight in his ($_bakugou) fist and evaluating other schools to look into , other masters he ($_bakugou) can learn from . 
But it feels wrong it feels like he ($_bakugou) should be following in All Might s steps and learning at Yuuei ($_yuuei) . 
How is he ($_bakugou) supposed to be great if he ($_bakugou) isn t learning from the greats ? What important friendships would he ($_bakugou) have made with the four nation s up and coming leaders like the Fire Nation heir ? How much easier would the path ahead have been , had he ($_bakugou) made those connections early ? 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) thinks of Todoroki s empty , calculating eyes and shudders . 
True , the prince didn t seem so easy to befriend . But being classmates at Yuuei ($_yuuei) would have been a good start . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) is trapped in a cycle of misery thinking of all that could have been and all that would never be . His ($_bakugou) mother , the saint that she is , has allowed him ($_bakugou) to mope for the week , only prompting him ($_bakugou) to eat and go to school . But otherwise , she s let him ($_bakugou) be . She saw it coming and understands that he ($_bakugou) needs time to come to terms . 
He ($_bakugou) doesn t respond when his ($_bakugou) mom announces she s going downstairs to grab the mail . But when he ($_bakugou) hears the thud of feet running up the stairs , he ($_bakugou) knows . 
I-Izuku ! His ($_bakugou) mom cries , crashing into the living room and presenting him ($_bakugou) a simple envelope . The Yuuei seal glistens on the front . It s here ! 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) simply stares at the black lettering for a moment . 
Then he ($_bakugou) silently rises from the couch , taking the letter from her hand and walking to his ($_bakugou) room . The door closes behind him ($_bakugou) with a resolute click and he ($_bakugou) takes a deep breath . 
Welp , this is it . 
Here is the confirmation that he ($_bakugou) needs a new plan . 
He ($_bakugou) sits at his ($_bakugou) desk , fingers hesitating at the seal . But impatience and curiosity soon overtake his ($_bakugou) fears and he ($_bakugou) rips it open , pulling the folded paper from inside and flattening it out . He ($_bakugou) hungrily begins to read . 
Midoriya_Izuku ($_midoriya) , it begins , not sparing even a moment for pleasantries . The following letter encloses the results of your entrance exam to Yuuei Bending Academy . 
Below the sentence is a chart . Column one : Written Exam . Column two : Power output . Column three : Combat score . 
The written exam is what he ($_bakugou) expected : he ($_bakugou) passed . Not with flying colors , but with a sizeable margin . 
The power score is actually better than he ($_bakugou) expected . 27 feet , a solid 10 feet above the average earthbending score . 
But the combat column is where he ($_bakugou) trembles . The 1 draws his ($_bakugou) eyes in like a magnet , confirming his ($_bakugou) fears . 
He ($_bakugou) didn t score nearly high enough to get in . 
He ($_bakugou) s toast . 
Resigned , he ($_bakugou) lets his ($_bakugou) eyes drift down to the sentence directly following the chart . 
Welcome to Yuuei . 
His ($_bakugou) eyes skim over the words , then he ($_bakugou) double-takes . He ($_bakugou) backtracks and reads it again . 
It stays the same : Welcome to Yuuei . 
This has to be some sort of mistake . He ($_bakugou) has to call them , to tell them they sent him ($_bakugou) the wrong letter . 
He ($_bakugou) skims the sentences below that , trying to gauge who the letter was actually meant for . The special observations section catches his ($_bakugou) eye . 
Note that another examinee on your combat team expressed a wish to share hit points with you ; this tells us you are cooperative and show a good temperament for collaboration . 
Uraraka -- it has to be Uraraka . She wanted to share points with me ? 
While lacking in the hits category in combat , you made up for those lost points in the teamwork/rescue portion of the test . Your teachers will work with you on your offense , but you demonstrate promise in rescue fields or teamwork-oriented bending jobs . 
... Teamwork and cooperation ? 
His gaze leaps back up to the chart , honing in on a subsection he missed beforehand : rescue points . The whopping 59 under it sharply contrasts the 1 in the hits category . 
It s not a mistake . 
He 
He actually got into Yuuei . 
A drop of water lands on the letter and blurs some of its ink , but Midoriya ($_midoriya) finds that he doesn t care . It s not until he starts crying in earnest that his mom worriedly raps on the door and asks to come in . 
Of course his first instinct is to tell All_Might ($_all) . 
The former avatar probably already knows , what with their spiritual connection and his worldly contacts . But Midoriya ($_midoriya) wants to tell him in person regardless , to thank him for the help and to maybe get some advice on how to proceed . 
He ll admit -- All Might doesn t seem so godlike anymore . If anything , he s a source of comfort , a pillar of stability and of common experience that Midoriya ($_midoriya) lacks in the waking world . 
-LRB- Maybe All_Might ($_all) is coming to feel less like something divine and more like family . -RRB- 
When Midoriya ($_midoriya) clambers into bed that night , he knows what to do . With his headphones playing a soft song for him , he lays flat on his back , gaze directed upwards towards the ceiling , and closes his eyes . 
He forces his heart to slow , makes himself ease his breathing and focus on the melody leaking into his ears . Breathe in, breathe out. His limbs melt into his bed . 
The music from his headphones gives way to a more all-encompassing hum -- the thrumming of the cosmos , of energy and space . He latches on , sees himself grab a fistful of that energy and watches it drag him into the unknown . 
When he opens his eyes again , he s not in his familiar forest . 
It 's the Spirit World -- that much Midoriya ($_midoriya) can tell -- , but it 's nothing like the tranquility of the towering trees he 's grown to know . 
The landscape is best described as a desert -- but rather than sand , it 's covered in dust . A barren horizon : no plants , no buildings , no people . Everything looks gray and dead . The air is dry and scratchy , and every breath feels like an assault on his throat . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) crouches to the ground , sifting a handful of the material through his ($_midoriya) fingers . It feels wrong . Something twinges in his ($_midoriya) chest and he ($_midoriya) can t say why , but something in the dust feels alive ? Tormented ? 
Is there someone buried here ? Was this dust formerly someone ? 
He ($_midoriya) begins to dig in haste -- looking for what , he ($_midoriya) does n't know . But if someone is in trouble , if someone is in pain , he ($_midoriya) has to help , he ($_midoriya) ca n't just leave them -- 
His ($_midoriya) hand brushes something solid and he ($_midoriya) halts for a moment . Then he ($_midoriya) starts again in earnest , frantically clawing at the dust . The thing begins to surface and , to his ($_midoriya) horror , he ($_midoriya) realizes that it 's a hand . 
He ($_midoriya) falls backwards on his ($_midoriya) butt , scooching away from the object . But it 's too late -- the hand shifts , free from its confinement , and spiders its way out of its dusty prison . 
Several things happen at once . 
The formerly stagnant air whips itself into a frenzy . Dust takes to the air , pelting Midoriya ($_midoriya) in sheets , invading his ($_midoriya) clothes , his ($_midoriya) eyes , his ($_midoriya) throat . He ($_midoriya) chokes -- more accurately , he ($_midoriya) drowns . 
The hand closes the gap , crawling over his ($_midoriya) foot and clamping onto his ($_midoriya) ankle . He ($_midoriya) wastes air and yelps , flailing his ($_midoriya) leg around desperately in an attempt to get it off . But his ($_midoriya) energy wanes ; he ($_midoriya) sinks , head hitting the ground . He ($_midoriya) can only watch the thing with his ($_midoriya) eyes , unable to escape . 
It might just be oxygen deprivation -- but Midoriya ($_midoriya) s blurring vision witnesses the dust by the hand swirl and combine into a crude attempt at a human body . 
The mass climbs its way up his ($_midoriya) unmoving torso , crushing the remaining air in him ($_midoriya) even faster than before . Its rough head settles right over Midoriya ($_midoriya) s . He ($_midoriya) tries to jerk his ($_midoriya) face away but finds that he ($_midoriya) ca n't . 
I know what you are , the words come , snake-like and tired and cold . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) s eyes widen ; he ($_midoriya) reaches at his ($_midoriya) last scraps of energy and renews his ($_midoriya) efforts to pull away . Instead , a dusty hand clamps down over his ($_midoriya) throat . He ($_midoriya) lets out a weak wheeze of agony . 
The thing leans in , almost brushing_Midoriya ($_midoriya) s nose . And then it laughs -- a nasally wheezing noise , a sad mockery of actual laughter . It sends a chill down Midoriya ($_midoriya) s spine . 
It belts out one more raspy chuckle . If it had a mouth , Midoriya ($_midoriya) imagines it would be smiling . 
You think you re safe ? That the world is safe ? it questions , a note of cruelty tinting its voice . 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) s head lulls , his ($_midoriya) eyelids drooping shut and the tension draining from his ($_midoriya) body . 
How naive. 
His ($_midoriya) eyes are closed and he ($_midoriya) s barely conscious but the next words are painfully clear . 
You obviously have no idea what 's coming . 
Something wraps firm arms under Midoriya ($_midoriya) s armpits , yanking him ($_midoriya) under the mound of dust and into the earth . He ($_midoriya) swallows dust and sees no more . 
x
A shriek rips its way out of Midoriya ($_midoriya) s throat as he ($_midoriya) bolts upright . 
Escape . 
He ($_midoriya) has to escape . 
There 's something confining his ($_midoriya) legs -- 
He ($_midoriya) kicks his ($_midoriya) way out from under his ($_midoriya) sheets , stumbling from his ($_midoriya) bed and tripping onto the floor . 
The soft carpeting of his ($_midoriya) room . Gentle moonlight trickling in from shuttered windows . Rectangles of bending idols watching over him ($_midoriya) from the walls . 
He ($_midoriya) 's in the real world . 
He ($_midoriya) 's safe . 
Muffled footsteps scramble down the hall and his ($_midoriya) mother rips open the door , hair ruffled and terror on her face . 
Izuku ($_izuku) ! What happened? 
Midoriya ($_midoriya) ca n't help it . A tiny sob fights its way out of his ($_midoriya) chest , then another . 
He ($_midoriya) 's cried in front of his ($_midoriya) mom before . This isn t new . 
But it feels different -- it s embarrassing . He ($_midoriya) s supposed to hold up the whole world but he ($_midoriya) can t even hold himself ($_midoriya) together . 
He ($_midoriya) drops his ($_midoriya) face in his ($_midoriya) hands . 
His ($_midoriya) mom pauses in the doorway , assessing the scene . Then , no questions asked , she glides over and sinks to the floor , wrapping her arms around him ($_midoriya) in a comforting embrace . 
There there , Izuku ($_izuku) , she murmurs , a hand rubbing up and down his ($_midoriya) back . It 'll all be okay . You 'll be fine . 
But it wo n't . And he ($_midoriya) wo n't . 
How is he ($_midoriya) supposed to go back to the Spirit World after that ? 
How is he ($_midoriya) supposed to talk to All Might with that thing there ? 
What is that thing ? What is it plotting ? 
How is he ($_midoriya) supposed to stop it ? 
In an instant , the weight of the world comes plummeting onto his ($_midoriya) back and he ($_midoriya) collapses under it , clinging to his ($_midoriya) mother and soaking her unknowing shoulders in the tears of a boy who was still precisely that : 
A boy .
