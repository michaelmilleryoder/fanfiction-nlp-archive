The band starts to play, and the recessional starts. Ross tries to take Emily’s hand, but she snatches it away from him.“Well, that went well,” Joey says sarcastically standing by Chandler, “Yeah.”“It could’ve been worse, he could’ve shot her,” Chandler replied sarcastically as Joey sighs.Ross and Emily make it to the lobby.Ross and Emily are in the bathroom and Emily is yelling at him. Rachel, Chandler, Joey, Monica and Richard are standing outside the doorway.“You’ve spoiled everything! It’s like a nightmare!” Emily yelled from inside the bathroom with Ross. “My friends and family are out there! How can I face them?! How can you do this to me?!”“Hey, no matter what happens with Ross and Emily, we still get cake right?” Joey asked quietly to the gang who gave him dirty looks and glares.Ross exits the bathroom.“That-that-that’s all right, no honey, you take your time sweetie,” Ross answered, freaked out and unable to think about how to fix this mess. “I’ll be right out here.”Emily slams the door in his face, absolutely furious.“She’s just fixing her makeup.”“I hate you!” Emily screamed in both anger and devastation.“And, I love you!” Ross called back trying to lighten the tension with his wife.The gang are giving him sympathetic looks feeling awful for Ross.Later on at the wedding reception, Chandler looks around and slowly walks up beside Joey, trying to act casual so no one would catch on and question them.“Hey,” Chandler says quietly, glancing around the room to make sure no one is looking at them.“Hey,” Joey answered, grabbing some food and put it on his plate.“Oh wow, I hope you don’t take this the wrong way but, I know we had plans to meet up tonight and…” Chandler begins to explain to Joey. He really didn't want to cancel tonight, but his friendship with Joey means more to him, and didn’t want to lose that. “Ugh, I’m just kinda worried about what it might do to our friendship.”“I know,” Joey agrees, still looking forward, trying not to attract attention. “How could we have let this happen?”“Ten times!”“Ugh! Well, y’know, we were away…” Joey says but Chandler interrupts him.“In a foreign country…” Chandler finished, sounding disappointed.“I blame London,” Joey said taking more food, not realizing he is over filling his plate.“Bad London!” Chandler said sarcastically. He takes a spoon and smacks the turkey.“So look umm, while we’re st-still in London, I mean…” Joey starts after some long minutes of awkward silence. He kept his voice down and gave him a sexy smirk which he knows that Chandler can't resist. “We can keep doing it right?”Chandler tried to avoid that sexy smirk and his face lightly turns into a shade of pink, casually looking down at his feet, “Well, I don’t see that we have a choice. But, when we’re back home, we don’t do it.”“Only here,” Joey agrees with a nod.“Y’know, I saw a wine cellar downstairs…” Chandler starts blushing even more; his face turning into a light shade of red.“I’ll meet you there in two minutes,” Joey instantly responded putting his food down. He grabbed a chicken wing and shoved it in his mouth.“K!”He throws down his plate and runs to the wine cellar, and Joey is about to follow him but realizes he needs some lotion or a condom. He runs into the next room quickly to try and find something.Richard and Monica are standing together talking with their plates of food. Rachel walks up to them.“Mon, honey, I gotta ask you something,” Rachel said and glanced up at Richard. “You too, Richard. Ross said my name up there, I mean, come on, I just can’t pretend that didn’t happen can I?”“Honey, I don't think that meant anything,” Monica admitted.“He wouldn't have said my name if he didn't love me,” Rachel protested as Monica and Richard glanced at each other. “Guys, what should I do?”“Nothing,” Monica said.“What?” Rachel asked confused about why Monica told her not to do anything. “I think I’m just gonna talk to Ross about what he think it meant.”Rachel tried to walk away but Monica grabbed her arm and pulled her back.“Rachel, no, he’s married,” Monica said firmly, but yet softly.“He’s married now,” Richard added in as Rachel looked up at him. “If you don’t realize that, we can’t help you.”“You have to let him go, Rach,” Monica said with her voice cracking a bit. “It’s too late. You need to move on.”“Okay, you’re right,” Rachel said holding back her tears as Monica rubbed her arm. “You’re both right. You guys can’t help me.”Rachel marched away feeling a tear trickle down her cheek.Joey is running up to Chandler who emerges from the wine cellar. He has a condom in his hand and shoves it in his pocket.“We were supposed to meet in the wine cellar, why are you back?” Joey asked impatiently tapping is foot.Chandler takes a deep breath, “Forget it, that’s off.”“Why?!” Joey asked frustrated.Mr. Waltham walks into the room from the wine cellar completely drunk and wasted.“The next tour of the wine cellar will plan in two in-in minutes…” He stuttered drunk before stumbling off. Joey and Chandler look at each other and groaned. Joey grabs a piece of chicken and starts eating it instead.“Joey, what are you doing?” Monica asked walking over to the boys while Richard is talking to her parents. “You promised Phoebe you wouldn’t eat meat until she has the babies!”“Well um, I uh…” Joey said almost at a loss for words, beginning to panic. “I figured we’re in another country, so it doesn’t count!”“The man’s got a point!” Chandler chims in equally as panicked as Joey nodded, forcing a smile on his face. “We are in a foreign… romantic-- I-I mean, um, fun country! I-It doesn’t count, Mon! So, s-stop asking so many questions!”“Ok…” Monica said bemused after a moment of awkward silence, and walked away.Ross and Rachel meet up and talk about how saying “Rachel” at the altar didn't mean a thing and in denial of their feelings. Joey finds them and approaches the discussion.“Hey, the band’s ready outside for your first dance with Emily, so…” Joey said, feeling slightly awkward.“Oh! Oh-oh, the band’s ready! Well, I-I-we gotta do what the band says…” Ross answers sarcastically then turns to a fit of anger. “I don’t care about the stupid band!”“You spit on me, man,” Joey said annoyed, then wipes his face in disgust.Ross’ face softens, “Look, I’m sorry."“Emily is kinda taking a long time, huh?” Joey replied, feeling sorry for Ross.Rachel forces herself to laugh, trying to throw in some humor to loosen the awkward tension between the three of them.“Y’know when I locked myself in the bathroom at my wedding, it was because I was trying to pop the window out of the frame.”“Oh, right!” Ross agrees with an awkward chuckle.“Get the hell out of there, y’know?” Rachel continues with a smirk.They all start laughing, and quickly stop when they realize what she just said and run over to the bathroom. Ross runs over to the bathroom in a panic attack, banging on the bathroom door.“Emily? Emily? I’m coming in!” Ross shouts, freaking out. He opens the door to reveal that the window is gone, along with Emily.“Well, look at that, same thing,” Rachel says, surprised.Later on at the London Marriott, Joey and Chandler are walking to their room. They are walking down the hallway until they reach their door. Joey grabs the key from his pocket.“Listen, in the middle of everything if I scream the word, "Yippee!" just ignore me,” Chandler explains as Joey rolls his eyes and chuckles. He opens the door to reveal Rachel sitting on a bed.“Oh my God, Rachel!” Joey said surprised and starting to panic a bit, not really knowing what to say. “Hi!”“Oh, hello Rachel,” Chandler says quietly, putting his hands on Joey’s shoulders, beginning to sweat.“Ross said my name. Okay? My name!” Rachel said frustrated, slapping her hands on the bed and stood up. “Ross said my name up there that obviously means that he still loves me!”The boys just stare at her, dumbstruck. They are unable to think of anything to say at this point. But they don't believe that Ross still loves her.“Okay, don’t believe me, I know I’m right,” Rachel finally said breaking the silence. “Do you guys want to go downstairs and get a drink?”“Yes, we do,” Chandler said, struggling with words that Rachel would believe. “But, we have to change first.”“Yes, I want to change,” Joey added in forcing a smile on his face. “And why-why don’t you go down and get us a table?”“Yeah, we’ll be down in like five minutes,” Chandler said before Joey got annoyed and elbows him really hard in the stomach. Chandler moans in slight pain.“Fifteen minutes,” Joey said quickly through gritted teeth as Chandler tried to hide his red face.“Okay,” Rachel said before the the phone rings and she sits down and answers it.“Hello? Oh, Pheebs!”  Rachel said with excitement and faces the men. “It’s Phoebe!”“Oh, yay…” Chandler said depressed but unnoticed by Rachel.“Great…” Joey finishes also depressed.Rachel starts to ramble on about how Ross fell in love with her and how she still thinks he loves her.“Okay, Pheebs, y’know what, let’s look at this objectively all right? Ninth grade, right? The obsession starts. All right? The summer after ninth grade he sees me in a two-piece for the first time, his obsession begins to grow. So then…”“Hey, listen, why don’t we go change in Monica and Richard’s room?” Chandler says quietly to Joey.“But our clothes are—ohh!” Joey then realizes what he means then they both leave quickly as Rachel is still rambling on.Joey opens the door slowly to see if Monica or Richard is there and after seeing that they aren’t, ushers Chandler into the room, closes the door, and the security bar. They both start to frantically rip each other’s clothes off, but are interrupted when Monica tries to open the door.“Hey, let me in!” Monica exclaimed annoyed. “I need to get changed!”“Well, I’ve got a-a girl in here…” Chandler said in a panic tone as Joey slapped his arm and gave him a dirty look.“No you don’t, I just saw you go in our room with Joey!” Monica said confused and angry that she can't get into her own room.“Well, we’re-we’re hanging out in here!” Joey tried to say, really hoping that Monica would just leave. “But, what if we’re watching a movie in here?”“Why can’t you do that in your own room?” Monica asked standing outside her hotel room.“Rachel is in our room talking to Phoebe on the phone,” Chandler replied. “We’re watching a movie, Mon! Come on!”“Which we are, and-and we already paid for it,” Joey said, grabbing thw movie off the counter. “It’s My Giant, my favorite movie!”“I don't care, guys!” Monica said angry as the men moaned. “I want to get in my room! Richard will be here in a minute! Let me in!”Monica starts banging on the door. Joey and Chandler look at each other and groan annoyed.Chandler and Joey are still looking for a place, so they enter the honeymoon suite.“You really think this is okay, Joe?” Chandler asked, blushing of how gorgeous the room is.“Well, Ross and Emily aren’t gonna use it,” Joey explained approaching Chandler and put his hands on his arms. Chandler tried to ignore that smirk again.“Y’know, I-I don’t know if I feel right about this,” Chandler said desperately restraining from kissing Joey’s lips."Oh Chandler, you are so adorable, look, his is the honeymoon suite,” Joey stated rubbing Chandler’s arms as his face turned more red. Only Joey can make him blush that hard. “The room expects sex. The room would be disappointed if it didn’t get sex. All of the other honeymoon suites would think it was a loser.”“Okay,” Chandler said agreeing with him now. He didn't care about Ross or Emily, he just wanted to have sex again.“Okay!”They both run to rip the covers off the bed, but are interrupted by Ross bursting into the room unannounced.“Emily?!” Ross shouts in a panic.“Nope, not under here!” Chandler exclaimed.“You didn’t find her?” Joey asked, occasionally glancing at Chandler, trying the best he can to hide his sexual feelings.“No, I’ve looked everywhere!”
