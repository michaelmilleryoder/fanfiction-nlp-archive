15360003,1,1,"Shouta_Aizawa ($_Aizawa_Shouta) was shaking and ready to puke, mentally kicking himself ($_Aizawa_Shouta) for his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) irrational anxiety."
15360003,1,2,"He ($_Aizawa_Shouta) was sitting alone as he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) tried prepare himself ($_Aizawa_Shouta) for his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) next match. Keyword being tried . He’d ($_Aizawa_Shouta) taken a peek at the current rankings and he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) was guaranteed to go up against a hero department kid for the second round no matter who it was that won the current bracket."
15360003,1,3,"Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) jumped when he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) heard a knock on the door. Would it kill people to leave him ($_Aizawa_Shouta) alone for once?"
15360003,1,4,"“Come in,” he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) said regardless, voice uneven."
15360003,1,5,"A familiar head of blonde hair popped into view, smile as bright as ever."
15360003,1,6,"“Ready Aizawa?” Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) asked. He ($_Yagi_Toshinori) stepped inside to reveal a scorched uniform, fire having eaten away at most of the blue fabric. There was ash on his ($_Yagi_Toshinori) face and the ends of his ($_Yagi_Toshinori) hair were a little singed as well. Seems his ($_Yagi_Toshinori) opponent didn’t bother holding back."
15360003,1,7,"Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) bit his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) lip. “I’m-”"
15360003,1,8,"Was he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) even ready? He’d ($_Aizawa_Shouta) have to go up regardless of how prepared he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) felt. His ($_Aizawa_Shouta) entire future depended on putting up another good fight, and if he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) so much as thought about backing down now then he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) might as well call it quits on being a hero entirely. There was a lot more than just a medal on the line. Winning held the power to open doors that had been closed in his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) face for years. Losing meant he’d ($_Aizawa_Shouta) be shoved to the sidelines once more, cursed to stare at the backs of his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) peers as they walked ahead of him ($_Aizawa_Shouta) towards the future. His ($_Aizawa_Shouta) situation was infuriating, to say the least."
15360003,1,9,"“I’ll admit that I’m a bit nervous, but I’ll figure something out,” he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) said. Analysis and quick-thinking had always been his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) strong points after all."
15360003,1,10,"Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) walked over and patted him ($_Aizawa_Shouta) on the back. “That’s the spirit! I’m sure you’ll do fine.”"
15360003,1,11,"Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) didn’t understand how the_blonde ($_Yagi_Toshinori) could smile through just about anything. It was almost as if smiling was his ($_Yagi_Toshinori) second quirk in addition to that destructive force of nature he ($_Yagi_Toshinori) dared shrug off as “a simple augmentation quirk”."
15360003,1,12,"‘Simple’ my ass, Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) thought. He’d ($_Aizawa_Shouta) seen Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) spar a few times and that_kid ($_Yagi_Toshinori) threw punches hard enough to knock down a tree. Without even touching it. Honestly, Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) was modest to a fault."
15360003,1,13,"His ($_Yagi_Toshinori) optimism wasn’t quite something to be admired either. Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) tended to think the best of everyone, friend or otherwise, without a second thought. He ($_Yagi_Toshinori) was like a puppy. As nice as it may seem to be able to live life wearing rose-tinted glasses it was going to get Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) into some serious trouble one day, mark his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) words. But Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) supposed there’s not much that can be done to change something so deeply ingrained in someone’s nature."
15360003,1,14,"“How did your fight go?” Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) asked, pushing the topic of conversation away from himself ($_Aizawa_Shouta)."
15360003,1,15,"If the uniform was of any indication, Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) had gone up against someone with a fire quirk. 20 bucks says it was that hot-headed Todoroki ($_Todoroki_Enji) the girls in general studies kept raving about."
15360003,1,16,"“I lost miserably,” Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) said, smile unwavering."
15360003,1,17,"There is something seriously wrong with this_guy ($_Yagi_Toshinori), Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) thought. “Please elaborate, I don’t see how utter defeat is something to be happy about.”"
15360003,1,18,"“You’re very right Aizawa, but I’m not smiling because I’m happy,” he ($_Yagi_Toshinori) said. “I’m smiling because I’m still alive to try to beat him next year.”"
15360003,1,19,"Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) rolled his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) eyes.  “If survival is enough to make you happy then you seem to have very low expectations,” he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) said drily."
15360003,1,20,"All Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) did in response was offer a laugh."
15360003,1,21,"Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) was certain the media would love Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori). Let’s just hope it doesn’t get to his ($_Yagi_Toshinori) head."
15360003,1,22,"“Do you have a strategy for your next match?” Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) asked, suddenly remembering why they were in the waiting room again in the first place."
15360003,1,23,"Okay, time to get a game plan going."
15360003,1,24,"“More or less. My quirk is a double edged sword, so I won’t know for certain what to do until I know who I’m up against.” While Erasure was certainly helpful for disarming opponents, it didn’t offer much in regards to actual combat. That, and it was exhausting to use for extended periods of time."
15360003,1,25,"He ($_Aizawa_Shouta) recalled Akiyama-senpai’s ($_Akiyama) suggestion to look into acquiring some sort of weapon after transfering into the hero department. Hopefully he’d ($_Aizawa_Shouta) get that chance soon."
15360003,1,26,"“As much as I love the occasional beatings Torino-sensei has begrudgingly offered to give me these past few weeks,” Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) continued, “I don’t know how well I’ll do this high-pressure-entertainment-combat thing a second time around. Any information you can give about my opponent?”"
15360003,1,27,"Yagi ($_Yagi_Toshinori) hummed. “I think Hizashi and Rikuto just finished their fight, actually. Well, regardless of who ended up winning I might still be able to give you a few pointers,” he ($_Yagi_Toshinori) said."
15360003,1,28,"They sat together and talked strategy for a few minutes before Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) was called up to start heading out to the stage. He ($_Aizawa_Shouta) awkwardly nodded goodbye and left."
15360003,1,29,"Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) worked on trying to steady his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) breathing as he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) walked down the stadium halls."
15360003,1,30,"He ($_Aizawa_Shouta) could do this. He ($_Aizawa_Shouta) had the advantage here, since he’d ($_Aizawa_Shouta) purposefully avoided drawing attention to his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) quirk up until this point. He’d ($_Aizawa_Shouta) survived the obstacle race and capture-the-flag with nothing but reflexes and logic, and as far as the audience knew he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) and his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) previous opponent had fought without quirks just for the hell of it. Of course, that wasn’t exactly the case but no one else needed to know that. He ($_Aizawa_Shouta) had the element of surprise on his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) side. He ($_Aizawa_Shouta) could do this. He ($_Aizawa_Shouta) could win."
15360003,1,31,"Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) stood in front of the entrance gate and waited for his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) name to be announced."
15360003,1,32,"“Moving on to our next fight,” the speakers finally announced."
15360003,1,33,"“Might we have a hidden genius among our ranks? I sure hope so, since the little guy hasn’t put up much of a show so far,” Gigawatt ($_Gigawatt) relented. “Once more, from the General Studies department, Aizawa Shouta!”"
15360003,1,34,"Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) took one last deep breath before going out into the arena."
15360003,1,35,"The crowd didn’t give him ($_Aizawa_Shouta) much of a greeting, his ($_Aizawa_Shouta) presence so far in the festival being little more than that of a shadow’s."
15360003,1,36,"I’ll make sure to change that in a few minutes, he ($_Aizawa_Shouta) thought."
15360003,1,37,"“And in the opposite corner: they say video killed the radio star, but this star just keeps on rising! From the Hero department, let’s give a warm welcome to 1-A’s very own,"
15360003,1,38,"“Yamada Hizashi!”"
15360003,1,39,"Shouta ($_Aizawa_Shouta) smirked."
15360003,1,40,"Let’s try to end this quickly."
15360003,1,41,"Hizashi ($_Yamada_Hizashi) laid on his ($_Yamada_Hizashi) back as he ($_Yamada_Hizashi) watched the clouds roll over Musutafu. His ($_Yamada_Hizashi) voice was gone, as well as what was left of his ($_Yamada_Hizashi) pride."
15360003,1,42,"'Aizawa Shouta, huh? Might have to learn that name.'"
